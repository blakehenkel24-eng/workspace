### McKinsey Frameworks

#### MECE Principle
> Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive

**What it is:** A structuring principle ensuring all options are covered without overlap.

**When to use:**
- Problem structuring
- Hypothesis generation
- Issue tree development
- Market segmentation

**Template:**
```
Problem: _______________________________

Branch 1: _______________
  - Sub-branch A
  - Sub-branch B

Branch 2: _______________
  - Sub-branch A
  - Sub-branch B

[Check: Are branches MECE?]
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Overlapping categories
- Missing edge cases
- Forcing MECE when not appropriate

---

#### Pyramid Principle
> Structure communication from conclusion to detail

**SCQA Framework:**
- **S**ituation: Context everyone agrees on
- **C**omplication: The problem or change
- **Q**uestion: The question this raises
- **A**nswer: Your recommendation

**Slide Structure:**
1. Governing thought (the "so what")
2. Key line points (supporting arguments)
3. Evidence (data, analysis)

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Slide Design

#### The Golden Rules
1. **One message per slide**
2. **Action titles only** — "Revenue increased 20%" not "Revenue analysis"
3. **So what? test** — Can the audience act on this?
4. **Data supports, doesn't lead** — Insights first, backup second
5. **30-second rule** — Slide should be understood in 30 seconds

#### Chart Selection Guide

| Message Type | Best Chart | Example |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| Comparison | Bar chart | Revenue by region |
| Trend | Line chart | Growth over time |
| Composition | Pie/Stacked bar | Market share |
| Distribution | Histogram | Customer concentration |
| Correlation | Scatter plot | Price vs volume |
| Flow | Waterfall | Bridge to growth |

#### Title Writing

❌ **Bad:** "Customer Analysis"  
✅ **Good:** "Top 20% of customers drive 65% of revenue"

❌ **Bad:** "Cost Structure"  
✅ **Good:** "Labor costs represent opportunity for 15% savings"

### Executive Communication

#### The Elevator Pitch Structure
```
1. Context (10 seconds)
   "We're evaluating [Company] for acquisition..."

2. Problem/Opportunity (15 seconds)
   "They have strong product-market fit but infrastructure gaps..."

3. Recommendation (15 seconds)
   "We recommend [action] to capture [value]..."

4. Ask (10 seconds)
   "We need your approval to proceed with [next step]..."
```

#### Managing Up
- Lead with answer
- Provide 3 options (with recommendation)
- Anticipate objections
- Bring solutions, not just problems
