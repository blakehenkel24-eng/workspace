## ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

### The 3-3-3 Rule (Daily)
- **3 posts** to engage with (thoughtful comments, not just likes)
- **3 new people** to connect with (personalized note)
- **3 replies** to your own post comments (within 2 hours)

### Response Time Targets
| Platform | Target Response Time | Notes |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| Twitter | Under 2 hours | Critical during launch week |
| LinkedIn | Under 4 hours | Acceptable for professional context |
| Reddit | Under 6 hours | Quality over speed |

### Engagement Templates

**Responding to Positive Comments:**
```
"Thanks [Name]! This is exactly why I built it. What's your biggest slide pain point?"
```

**Responding to Skeptical Comments:**
```
"Fair point, [Name]. The goal isn't to replace thinking — it's to remove the tedious parts. Curious: what would YOU automate if you could?"
```

**Responding to Beta Signup Interest:**
```
"Awesome! Sending you a DM with early access details. Would love your feedback once you've tried it."
```
