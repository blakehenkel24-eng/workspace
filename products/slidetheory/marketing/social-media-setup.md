```
I help technology leaders make better decisions.

After [X years] building and scaling data platforms [at/for Company], I realized most tech strategy failures stem from the same problem: we're drowning in data but starving for frameworks.

That's why I built SlideTheory — a methodology that transforms how leaders approach technology strategy, data architecture, and organizational decision-making.

What I do:
→ Strategic technology advisory for scaling companies
→ Data system design and architecture review
→ Framework development for internal decision-making
→ Executive coaching for technical leaders

[short paragraph + link] |

## 3. Reddit

**Purpose:** Community participation, establishing expertise, indirect lead generation (no direct promo).

### Account Setup

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Username** | blakehenkel (if available), blakehenkel_consulting, or similar |
| **Important:** Reddit usernames are permanent — choose carefully |
| **Profile** | Minimal, professional. No links in bio (can appear spammy) |

### Profile Picture
- SlideTheory logo (small, recognizable at 64×64px)
- Or generic professional avatar
- Reddit avatars can be customized with their avatar builder

### Banner
- Reddit profile banners are optional and less critical
- If used: SlideTheory brand colors, minimal text
- Dimensions: 1920×384px

### Bio/Description
Keep minimal. Reddit favors authenticity over polished branding:
```
Tech consultant. I help companies make sense of their data and strategy. Occasional writer.
```

### Target Subreddits (Priority Order)

| Subreddit | Focus | Engagement Type |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| r/consulting | Core community | Primary engagement |
| r/ExperiencedDevs | Senior tech perspective | Insightful comments |
| r/dataengineering | Technical expertise | Problem-solving |
| r/startups | Founder perspective | Advisory comments |
| r/techlead | Leadership angle | Experience sharing |
| r/SaaS | Business strategy | Framework sharing |

### First 5 Posts/Comments Strategy

| # | Action | Details |
|---|--------|---------|
| **1** | Comment on trending r/consulting post | Provide detailed, experience-backed answer to "How do I break into consulting?" or similar |
| **2** | Comment on r/ExperiencedDevs | Technical perspective on architecture or team scaling question |
| **3** | Original post on r/consulting | "I built a framework for [specific consulting problem] after seeing it fail 3 times. Here's what I learned." [Value-first, no pitch] |
| **4** | Detailed comment | Answer a complex question where you can demonstrate deep expertise |
| **5** | Comment on r/dataengineering | Technical insight on data strategy or tooling decision |

### Engagement Strategy — CRITICAL RULES

**DO:**
- Provide genuine value in every comment
- Share frameworks and methodologies freely
- Answer questions thoroughly
- Build karma and reputation over weeks before any soft mention
- Use specific examples and data

**DON'T:**
- Post links to your website (will be flagged as spam)
- Say "PM me for consulting services"
- Use obviously promotional language
- Post the same content across multiple subs rapidly
- Create new account and immediately promote

**Soft Promotion Approach (After 4-6 weeks):**
- "I've written about this in more detail [if someone asks]"
- "I built a framework for this — happy to share the overview"
- "This is basically what I do for a living — happy to expand on any part"
- Let interested users DM you

### Best Times to Post (Reddit — US Tech Audience)

## Brand Voice Guidelines

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Clear** | No jargon without explanation. Simple language for complex topics. | "Here's what that means in plain English..." |
| **Confident** | Expertise without arrogance. Own your experience. | "In my experience, this pattern fails 90% of the time." |
| **Practical** | Always actionable. Theory must lead to action. | "Here's exactly how to implement this..." |
| **Conversational** | Write like you speak. Professional but human. | "Look, I've made this mistake myself..." |
| **Data-Informed** | Back claims with specifics when possible. | "We saw a 40% improvement after implementing..." |

### Language Do's and Don'ts

**DO Use:**
- "Frameworks" (core concept)
- "Here's what I learned"
- "The mistake most people make"
- Specific numbers and examples
- Questions to engage readers

**DON'T Use:**
- Buzzwords without substance ("synergy", "leverage")
- Over-promising ("guaranteed results")
- Excessive humility ("I'm no expert, but...")
- Aggressive sales language
- Jargon without context

### Platform Tone Adjustments

| Platform | Tone Adjustment |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Twitter/X** | Punchier, more opinionated, thread-friendly |
| **LinkedIn** | More formal, career-focused, leadership-oriented |
| **Reddit** | Authentic, self-aware, no marketing speak |
| **YouTube** | Conversational, educational, personality-forward |
| **TikTok** | Casual, trend-aware, quick-hitting |

---

## Cross-Posting Strategy

### Content Repurposing Flow

```
Long-Form Article (LinkedIn/Blog)
    ↓
    ├── Twitter Thread (break into 10-15 tweets)
    ├── YouTube Video (expand with visuals)
    ├── LinkedIn Post (summary + link)
    └── TikTok (one key insight, 30 seconds)

YouTube Video
    ↓
    ├── Shorts (extract 60-sec segments)
    ├── Twitter (key quotes/screenshots)
    ├── LinkedIn (summary post)
    └── TikTok (reformatted clips)

Twitter Thread
    ↓
    ├── LinkedIn (reformatted as article)
    ├── Screenshots for Instagram (if launched)
    └── Newsletter content (if launched)
```

### Platform-Specific Adaptations

**Never post identical content across platforms.** Always adapt:

| Original | Adaptation |
|----------|------------|
| LinkedIn article (1,500 words) | Twitter thread (10 tweets) — rewrite for flow, add tweet-specific hooks |
| YouTube video (12 min) | TikTok (45 sec) — one core insight, punchy delivery |
| Twitter thread | LinkedIn post — convert to paragraph format, remove tweet numbering |
| Long-form blog | Reddit post — more conversational, remove promotional elements |

### Cross-Linking Best Practices

1. **Link TO everything FROM everything:**
   - Twitter bio → LinkedIn + YouTube + SlideTheory site
   - YouTube description → Twitter + LinkedIn + newsletter
   - LinkedIn featured → best articles + YouTube + SlideTheory

2. **Soft mentions:**
   - "I wrote about this in more detail on LinkedIn"
   - "Full video breakdown on my YouTube channel"
   - "This thread is adapted from my latest article"

3. **UTM parameters for tracking:**
   - `?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=content`
   - Track which platforms drive the most traffic
