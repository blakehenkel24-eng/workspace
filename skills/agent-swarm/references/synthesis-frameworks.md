# Synthesis Frameworks

## Report Structure Template

### Executive Summary
- Problem statement (1 sentence)
- Key findings (3-5 bullets)
- Recommended actions (prioritized)
- Expected impact

### Detailed Findings
Organize by domain:
1. Market/Competitive Landscape
2. Technical Considerations
3. Financial Implications
4. Strategic Opportunities
5. Risk Factors

### Action Plan
- Immediate actions (0-30 days)
- Short-term actions (1-3 months)
- Medium-term actions (3-6 months)
- Resource requirements

### Supporting Materials
- Data tables and charts
- Detailed agent outputs (appendix)
- Methodology notes

## Cross-Agent Conflict Resolution

When agents disagree:

1. **Identify the conflict type:**
   - Factual disagreement → Check data sources, cite evidence
   - Interpretation difference → Present both views with confidence levels
   - Recommendation conflict → Evaluate against user goals

2. **Resolution approaches:**
   - Confidence weighting: Higher confidence agent's view prevails
   - Conditional recommendations: "If X is true, do A; if Y is true, do B"
   - Hybrid approach: Combine elements from both recommendations

3. **Flag for user decision when:**
   - High-stakes strategic choice
   - Insufficient data to resolve
   - Depends on unstated user preferences

## Confidence Scoring

Add confidence indicators to synthesized findings:

- **High confidence:** Multiple agents agree, strong data support
- **Medium confidence:** Some evidence, limited validation
- **Low confidence:** Single agent view, speculative, needs verification

Mark low-confidence items as "Recommended for validation"
