Beautiful proposals for ambitious consultants

## Short Description (60 chars)

Win more consulting deals with professional proposals

## Full Description

### The Problem

You're a skilled consultant. You've solved complex problems, delivered results, and built expertise worth premium fees.

But when it comes to proposals? You're using the same tools everyone else uses — and looking like everyone else.

Top consulting firms have entire teams designing their proposals. As a solo consultant or boutique firm, you're competing with McKinsey decks created on PowerPoint and prayers.

The result? Great consultants lose deals they should win. Not because they lack capability — because they lack presentation.

### The Solution

SlideTheory is presentation software built specifically for consultants who want to win bigger deals.

We studied 200+ winning consulting proposals from top firms and independent practitioners. We identified the patterns that convert. The frameworks that work. The psychology of client decisions.

Then we built it into every template, every slide, every interaction.

### What Makes SlideTheory Different

🎯 **Consulting-Specific Templates**
Not generic slide decks. Templates designed for strategy proposals, implementation roadmaps, case study presentations, and pricing conversations.

🧠 **Built on Winning Psychology**
Every template follows proven frameworks: Problem-first structure, visual hierarchy that guides attention, and pricing slides that convert.

⚡ **Designed for Speed**
Create a professional proposal in under an hour. Smart defaults, pre-built sections, and intelligent formatting mean you spend less time designing and more time winning.

💼 **Big Firm Quality, Indie Budget**
Compete with the McKinseys of the world without their design teams. Professional typography, refined color palettes, and polished layouts — automatically.

🔄 **From First Contact to Signed Contract**
SlideTheory isn't just proposals. It's pre-meeting decks, portfolio presentations, pricing conversations, and follow-up sequences. Your entire sales process, beautifully designed.

### Pricing

- **Team**: $79/month — Everything in Pro plus collaboration, shared libraries, admin controls

### The Story

I spent 10 years building proposals for consulting firms — from solo practitioners to Big 4 teams. I watched brilliant consultants lose deals because their proposals didn't match their expertise.

The tools were broken. PowerPoint and Google Slides aren't designed for consulting sales. They're designed for... slides.

So I built what I wished I'd had: Presentation software that understands how consultants win deals.

That's SlideTheory.

## Maker Comments (for discussion)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Name], and I've spent the last decade helping consultants win over $50M in engagements. Today I'm launching SlideTheory — presentation software built specifically for consulting proposals.

**Why I Built This**

After reviewing hundreds of consulting proposals, I noticed a pattern: The consultants losing deals weren't less capable. They simply didn't have the tools to present their expertise effectively.

Big firms have design teams. Solo consultants have PowerPoint.

That didn't seem fair.

**What SlideTheory Does**

We studied 200+ winning proposals and built the patterns into templates:
- Problem-first frameworks
- Visual hierarchies that guide decisions
- Pricing slides that convert

Everything designed specifically for consulting sales.

**Ask Me Anything**

Happy to answer questions about:
- Consulting proposal psychology
- What separates winning proposals from losing ones
- Building productized services
- Anything else!

Thanks for checking it out! 🙏

## First Commenter Response Templates

**On pricing:**
Great question! We kept pricing accessible because I remember being a solo consultant where every $ mattered. The free tier gets you 3 proposals/month which is enough to test the product. Once you're winning bigger deals, Pro pays for itself with one additional project.

**On templates:**
Templates cover strategy proposals, implementation plans, case study presentations, pricing decks, pre-meeting briefs, and portfolio showcases. Plus we're adding 2-3 new templates every month based on user requests.

**On differentiation:**
Unlike generic tools, SlideTheory bakes consulting-specific psychology into every template. The structure, the flow, even the white space — it's all designed based on what actually wins consulting deals.

**On integrations:**
Currently export to PDF and PowerPoint. CRM integrations (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive) are in development and should ship next month!
