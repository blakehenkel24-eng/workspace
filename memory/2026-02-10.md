# 2026-02-10 — Perplexity/OpenRouter Integration

## Changes Made

### API Keys Added
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` added to `/home/node/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- Provides access to Perplexity models via OpenRouter

### New Models Configured

#### perplexity/sonar-pro-search
- **Purpose:** Default web search (replaces Brave as primary)
- **Cost:** Standard
- **Usage:** All regular web searches

#### perplexity/sonar-deep-research  
- **Purpose:** Intensive research tasks
- **Cost:** Higher (⚠️ expensive)
- **Usage:** ONLY when explicitly requested

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL OPERATING RULE

### When to Use Deep Research Model

**ONLY** use `perplexity/sonar-deep-research` when Blake explicitly mentions:
- "deep research"
- "do a ton of research"
- "extensive research"
- "comprehensive research"
- Similar phrasing indicating intensive research is needed

**Default behavior:** Use `perplexity/sonar-pro-search` for all other web searches.

### Why This Matters
- Deep research is significantly more costly
- OpenRouter bills per token
- Blake explicitly requested cost-conscious usage

---

## Gateway Restart
Gateway was restarted at 03:24 UTC to apply the new API key configuration.

## Files Updated
- `/home/node/.openclaw/openclaw.json` — Added OPENROUTER_API_KEY
- `TOOLS.md` — Documented Perplexity models and usage rules
- `memory/2026-02-10.md` — This file (research rules)

---

*Enforce the deep research trigger rule strictly. When in doubt, use sonar-pro-search.*
