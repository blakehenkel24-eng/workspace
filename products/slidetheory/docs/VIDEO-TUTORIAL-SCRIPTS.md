### Script

**[Scene: Screen recording of slidetheory.io homepage]**

**Host:**
"Welcome to SlideTheory. In the next three minutes, you'll create your first professional consulting slide."

**[Mouse clicks on "Get Started" or navigates to app]**

**Host:**
"SlideTheory is an AI-powered slide generator designed for consultants. You provide the content, and our AI structures it using proven frameworks like the Pyramid Principle."

**[Screen shows the main interface with input form]**

**Host:**
"Let's create an Executive Summary slide. First, select your slide type from the dropdown. For board presentations and high-level overviews, Executive Summary is perfect."

**[Selects "Executive Summary" from dropdown]**

**Host:**
"Next, tell us who you're presenting to. This adjusts the style automatically. For this example, let's say we're presenting to a Board."

**[Selects "Board" from audience dropdown]**

**Host:**
"Now, the key takeaway. This is the single most important message. Think of it as the answer you'd give if someone asked 'What's the one thing I should remember?'"

**[Types in Key Takeaway field]**
"Revenue growth of 25% positions us for a successful Series B."

**Host:**
"Great. Now add context. This is where you provide the supporting details. Be specific with numbers and mention any relevant market dynamics."

**[Types in Context field]**
"Q3 results for board review. Revenue reached $4.2M, up 25% year-over-year. Customer acquisition improved with CAC down 15%. Two major competitors raised pricing, creating an opportunity. We need board approval to expand the sales team."

**Host:**
"Finally, add any specific data points. These will be formatted prominently on your slide."

**[Enters data points]**
"Revenue: $4.2M (+25%), Customers: 1,240 (+45%), Gross Margin: 68%"

**Host:**
"Ready? Click Generate or press Ctrl-Enter."

**[Clicks Generate button]**

**Host:**
"The AI is analyzing your context, structuring the content, and designing the slide. This usually takes about 3 seconds."

**[Loading animation plays]**

**Host:**
"And there it is. Your slide follows the classic Executive Summary structure: title, three key points, and a clear recommendation."

**[Slide appears in preview panel]**

**Host:**
"Notice how the AI emphasized your metrics and organized the content hierarchically. If you'd like a different variation, click Regenerate. Otherwise, let's download it."

**[Clicks Download dropdown, selects PPTX]**

**Host:**
"I recommend PPTX format if you want to edit in PowerPoint later. PNG is great for email, and PDF works well for printing."

**[File downloads]**

**Host:**
"Your slide is ready. In under three minutes, you went from raw context to a professional consulting slide. That's SlideTheory."

**[Screen shows final slide with call-to-action]**

**Host:**
"Try it yourself at slidetheory.io. Thanks for watching!"

## Tutorial 2: Choosing the Right Slide Type (4 minutes)

### Target Audience
Users who have created 1-2 slides and want to expand

### Learning Objectives
- Understand when to use each slide type
- Match slide type to communication goal

---

### Script

**Host:**
"SlideTheory offers five slide types. Choosing the right one ensures your message lands effectively. Let's explore each."

**[Screen shows slide type selector]**

**Host:**
"First, Executive Summary. Use this when you need to convey a recommendation with supporting rationale. It's perfect for board meetings and final readouts. The structure is: title, key points, recommendation."

**[Shows example Executive Summary slide]**

**Host:**
"Next, Horizontal Flow. This creates left-to-right process diagrams. Use it for customer journeys, implementation timelines, or step-by-step workflows."

**[Shows Horizontal Flow example]**

**Host:**
"Notice how the AI automatically spaces elements and adds connecting arrows. Just describe your process steps in order."

**[Switch to Vertical Flow]**

**Host:**
"Vertical Flow builds top-down hierarchies. Think org charts, issue trees, or decision trees. This uses the MECE principle — Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive."

**[Shows Vertical Flow example]**

**Host:**
"For data-heavy presentations, use Graph or Chart. The AI will suggest the best visualization based on your data — bars for comparisons, lines for trends, pie for proportions."

**[Shows Graph/Chart example with data]**

**Host:**
"Finally, General is your flexible option when none of the specific types fit. It gives the AI more freedom to design a custom layout."

**[Shows General example]**

**Host:**
"Quick tip: Start with the slide type that matches your instinct, but don't be afraid to try others. The same context can work across multiple types, and sometimes the alternative view reveals new insights."

**[Split screen shows same context in different slide types]**

**Host:**
"That's it for slide types. Match your message to the structure, and let SlideTheory handle the design."

## Tutorial 3: Writing Great Context (5 minutes)

### Target Audience
Intermediate users who want better output quality

### Learning Objectives
- Structure context for optimal AI output
- Include the right level of detail
- Avoid common mistakes

---

### Script

**Host:**
"The quality of your slide depends on the context you provide. Let's look at how to write context that gets great results."

**[Screen shows the context input field]**

**Host:**
"The golden rule: be specific. Vague context produces generic slides."

**[Shows bad example]**
"We had a good quarter."

**Host:**
"This gives the AI almost nothing to work with. Compare that to this improved version."

**[Shows good example]**
"Q3 revenue was $4.2M, up 23% year-over-year. Customer acquisition improved with CAC down 15%. Two major competitors raised prices by 10%, creating a pricing power opportunity. We need board approval for a $500K sales team expansion."

**Host:**
"Much better. Let's break down why."

**[Highlights elements]**

**Host:**
"First, concrete numbers. Twenty-three percent growth is more useful than 'good quarter.' Second, causality. The AI understands that competitor price increases create opportunity. Third, the decision needed. This helps the AI frame the recommendation."

**Host:**
"Here's a framework I use: the Five Questions."

**[Shows on screen]**
1. What's the situation?
2. What's the complication?
3. What's the key question?
4. What are the options?
5. What's the recommendation?

**Host:**
"Answer these in your context, and the AI has everything it needs."

**Host:**
"Now, common mistakes to avoid."

**[Shows examples]**

**Host:**
"Mistake one: copying and pasting entire documents. The context field has a 2000-character limit for a reason. Summarize the key points instead."

**Host:**
"Mistake two: multiple key messages. Stick to one clear takeaway per slide. If you have multiple messages, create multiple slides."

**Host:**
"Mistake three: insider jargon without explanation. Remember, the AI doesn't know your company's internal terminology. Spell out acronyms and explain terms."

**Host:**
"Here's a pro tip. Before writing context, ask yourself: if I had 30 seconds to explain this to a smart colleague from a different department, what would I say? Write that."

**Host:**
"With practice, writing great context becomes second nature. Your reward? Better slides on the first try."

## Tutorial 4: Advanced Features (6 minutes)

### Target Audience
Power users and teams

### Learning Objectives
- Use keyboard shortcuts effectively
- Work with data imports
- Leverage templates

---

### Script

**Host:**
"Ready to become a SlideTheory power user? Let's explore advanced features that will speed up your workflow."

**[Screen shows keyboard shortcuts modal]**

**Host:**
"First, keyboard shortcuts. Press question mark anytime to see the full list."

**[Presses ? key]**

**Host:**
"The big three: Ctrl-Enter generates, Ctrl-R regenerates, and Ctrl-D downloads. These shortcuts save seconds on every slide, which adds up over a project."

**Host:**
"Next, data imports. Instead of typing data manually, you can upload CSV or Excel files."

**[Clicks upload button, selects file]**

**Host:**
"SlideTheory parses the file and extracts key metrics. It's smart enough to recognize headers, currencies, and percentages."

**[Shows parsed data in preview]**

**Host:**
"For complex datasets, format your file with clear column headers. The AI uses these to label charts correctly."

**[Shows example CSV format]**

**Host:**
"Templates are another time-saver. Instead of starting from scratch, browse our template library for common scenarios."

**[Opens templates panel]**

**Host:**
"Each template includes pre-filled context and data points. Click to load, adjust the specifics, and generate."

**[Selects template, shows auto-populated form]**

**Host:**
"For teams, we offer shared templates. Your organization can create and distribute templates that match your brand guidelines."

**Host:**
"Let's talk about Presentation Mode versus Read Mode. You'll see this toggle in the form."

**[Shows mode toggle]**

**Host:**
"Presentation Mode creates slides with less text and more whitespace — perfect for live talks. Read Mode includes more detail for documents people read on their own."

**[Shows comparison]**

**Host:**
"One more pro tip: the regenerate feature. If the first output isn't perfect, don't start over. Click regenerate — the AI will try a different layout with the same inputs. Often, the second or third variation is the winner."

**[Clicks regenerate button multiple times]**

**Host:**
"With these advanced features, you'll create better slides in half the time."

## Tutorial 5: Export and Integration (4 minutes)

### Target Audience
Users integrating SlideTheory into their workflow

### Learning Objectives
- Choose the right export format
- Edit exported slides
- Integrate with other tools

---

### Script

**Host:**
"You've created a great slide. Now let's get it into your presentation. SlideTheory offers four export formats, each with different use cases."

**[Screen shows export dropdown]**

**Host:**
"PNG is a high-resolution image. Use this for embedding in documents, email, or websites. It's the most compatible format — anywhere you can paste an image, PNG works."

**[Shows PNG export and usage in various apps]**

**Host:**
"PPTX exports to Microsoft PowerPoint format. This is editable — you can change text, colors, and move elements. If you need to customize the slide after generation, choose PPTX."

**[Opens exported PPTX in PowerPoint, edits text]**

**Host:**
"Note that complex layouts may require some adjustment in PowerPoint. The AI does its best, but every presentation software handles formatting slightly differently."

**Host:**
"PDF is ideal for printing or formal distribution. It maintains vector quality at any size, so your slides look crisp whether printed on letter paper or displayed on a conference room screen."

**[Shows PDF export, zooms to show quality]**

**Host:**
"HTML export gives you the raw code. Developers can embed this directly in web applications or customize the styling with CSS."

**[Shows HTML code snippet]**

**Host:**
"For teams using Google Slides, here's a workflow: export as PPTX, upload to Google Drive, then open with Google Slides. Most formatting transfers correctly."

**[Demonstrates the workflow]**

**Host:**
"If you use Keynote on Mac, the PPTX import works well too. Occasionally, fonts may need adjustment since SlideTheory uses web fonts."

**Host:**
"For API users, you can automate exports. Set up a webhook to receive the download URL when generation completes, then integrate with your document management system."

**[Shows API code snippet]**

**Host:**
"Choose the format that fits your workflow, and remember — you can always export the same slide in multiple formats."
