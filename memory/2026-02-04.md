# Memory Log — 2026-02-04

## SlideTheory MVP Testing

### Issues Discovered
1. **Kimi API timeout** — Network latency to China (270ms-2000ms) causes timeouts
2. **Puppeteer/Chrome missing** — Mac doesn't have Chrome installed for rendering
3. **SVG extension bug** — Fallback saves SVG with .png extension (fixed)

### Fixes Applied
- ✅ Increased API timeout to 60s
- ✅ Fixed SVG extension in slide-generator.js (now saves as .svg)
- ✅ Pushed fix to GitHub

### Next Steps
- Install Chrome for Puppeteer: `npx puppeteer browsers install chrome`
- Or switch to OpenAI API for faster US-based servers
- Test SVG display after fix

## GitHub Unblocked
- User unblocked secret scanning protection
- Push access restored
- Avatar and MVP fixes pushed successfully

## Workspace Cleanup
- Archived old projects (7.3MB freed)
- Consolidated duplicate SlideTheory folders
- Created MVP-SPEC.md and FUTURE-SPEC.md

## Client Hawk
- Created prototype.html with briefing UI
- Shows daily intelligence feed with AI suggestions

## TODO for Tomorrow
1. Test MVP with SVG fix
2. Install Chrome or switch to OpenAI
3. Research Nano Banana model
4. Source MBB slide examples
