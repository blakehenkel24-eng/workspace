## Pitch 2: The Freelance Revolution Podcast

**Target Show:** Podcast for freelancers and independent professionals

**Subject:** Guest pitch: From consultant to SaaS founder — lessons from the transition

**Email:**

Hi [Host Name],

Your episode on [specific topic] resonated with me because I'm currently navigating the consultant-to-founder transition myself. Your guest's point about [specific insight] is exactly what I've experienced building SlideTheory.

**Why I'm reaching out:**

I spent 10 years as a consultant before bootstrapping SlideTheory to $10K MRR. I think your audience would benefit from hearing:

- How consulting skills transfer to product-building
- Why the same sales psychology works for services and SaaS
- The mistake of waiting too long to productize expertise
- How to leverage your consulting network for your first customers

**My story:**

- Started as solo consultant, built to small practice
- Noticed every consultant I knew struggled with proposals
- Built internal templates that other consultants wanted
- Validated demand, built SlideTheory nights/weekends
- Quit consulting to go full-time on product
- Now at $10K MRR, growing profitably

**Episode angles I'd suggest:**

1. "The Consulting Skills That Transfer to SaaS"
2. "Productizing Your Expertise: A Step-by-Step Framework"
3. "Using Your Network as Your First Go-to-Market"

**What makes this timely:**

A lot of freelancers are thinking about productizing their services. I can share the practical steps (and hard lessons) from actually doing it.

I'm also happy to share:
- My "validation before building" framework
- The exact metrics that told me it was time to quit consulting
- Why I chose bootstrap over VC

Available for recording [days/times] or can work around your schedule.

Thanks for the great work you do with the podcast. I've recommended it to every freelancer I know.

Best,

## Pitch 3: The Productized Service Podcast

**Target Show:** Podcast focused on productized consulting/services

**Subject:** Guest pitch: Productizing the consulting proposal

**Email:**

Hi [Host Name],

Big fan of the show — your framework for productizing services helped me structure SlideTheory's offering. Specifically, your episode on [topic] gave me the clarity to [specific outcome].

**Why I'm reaching out:**

I productized something most consultants consider completely custom: the proposal process.

SlideTheory started when I noticed every consultant I knew was reinventing the wheel for every proposal. Same sections, same structure, same mistakes — built from scratch every time.

**What I learned productizing proposals:**

- Why even "custom" services have 80% repeatable components
- The template paradox: Standardization increases quality
- How to balance customization with efficiency
- Pricing productized services vs. custom consulting
- The operational systems that make productization work

**About SlideTheory:**

- Proposal software/templates specifically for consultants
- Templates based on 200+ winning proposals
- Customers range from solo consultants to 20-person boutiques
- $29-79/month pricing (vs. $10K+ custom engagements)
- Bootstrapped, profitable

**Episode angles:**

1. "Productizing the Unproductizable: The Proposal Case Study"
2. "The 80/20 of Consulting Deliverables"
3. "Why Templates Don't Mean Commoditization"

**Unique perspective:**

I've been on both sides — selling $50K custom engagements AND $29/month subscriptions. I can compare the psychology, operations, and profitability of each model.

I think your audience of service business owners would find this especially relevant as they think about productizing their own expertise.

Available anytime in [time zone] or can accommodate your schedule.

Keep up the great work!

## Pitch 4: The Solo Consultant Show

**Target Show:** Podcast for independent/solo consultants

**Subject:** Guest pitch: Looking like a big firm on a solo budget

**Email:**

Hi [Host Name],

Your episode on [specific topic] hit home — I've faced that exact challenge as a solo consultant competing against Deloitte teams. Your advice about [specific point] was spot-on.

**Why I'm reaching out:**

I went from Big 4 to solo consulting, and the hardest adjustment wasn't the work — it was the perception gap.

Solo consultants face an unfair disadvantage: We compete with big firms that have design teams, brand recognition, and polished proposals. But we CAN level the playing field.

**What I can share with your audience:**

- How to create proposals that look like McKinsey decks (without the McKinsey budget)
- The pre-meeting strategy that builds credibility before you say a word
- Why niching down makes you look bigger, not smaller
- The presentation psychology that signals "established firm"
- Tools and tactics that create big-firm presence

**My background:**

- 5 years at [Big 4/Name firm]
- 5 years independent consultant
- Built solo practice to $300K/year before productizing
- Now helping other consultants compete effectively

**Episode ideas:**

1. "Big Firm Tactics for Solo Consultants"
2. "The Visual Credibility Gap (And How to Close It)"
3. "Competing with Deloitte When You're a Team of One"

**Why this matters now:**

Economic uncertainty means more competition for fewer deals. Solo consultants need every advantage they can get to stand out against well-resourced competitors.

I can provide actionable tactics your listeners can implement immediately — no budget required.

## Pitch 5: The Business of Expertise Podcast

**Target Show:** Podcast about selling expertise-based services

**Subject:** Guest pitch: The presentation of expertise (why how you sell matters as much as what you sell)

**Email:**

Hi [Host Name],

I've listened to every episode of [Podcast Name]. Your concept of [specific framework/concept from show] fundamentally shaped how I think about positioning SlideTheory.

**Why I'm reaching out:**

You talk a lot about the *content* of expertise — frameworks, methodologies, thought leadership.

I'd love to talk about the *presentation* of expertise. Because I've learned that how you package your expertise matters as much as the expertise itself.

**What I mean:**

- The proposal that looks like a Word document vs. one that looks like a strategy deck
- The consultant who articulates the problem vs. the one who lists credentials
- The pricing presented as "hours × rate" vs. "investment in outcome"

Same expertise. Completely different perceived value.

**What I can contribute:**

- The 5-second competence signal — why clients decide before they read
- Visual authority — how design signals expertise
- The paradox of polished presentation: Why it matters more for experts than novices
- Case studies: Before/after transformations of expertise presentation

**My perspective:**

10 years building proposals for experts who struggled to communicate their value. I became obsessed with the gap between capability and perceived capability.

That obsession became SlideTheory — tools that help experts present their expertise as effectively as they've developed it.

**Suggested topics:**

1. "Why the Best Experts Often Present the Worst Proposals"
2. "The Packaging of Expertise: Presentation as Positioning"
3. "Closing the Capability Gap: When Your Expertise Exceeds Your Pitch"

**Connection to your work:**

This complements your episodes on [related topics] by addressing the practical presentation layer. Experts can have perfect positioning and still lose deals because of poor presentation.

I'd be honored to contribute to the conversation you've built.

P.S. — Happy to share any of our research on proposal psychology if useful for your content planning.
