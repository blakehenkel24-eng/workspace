### 3. AI/ML Engineer - Agent: ai-ml-engineer
**Role:** Prompt engineering, model optimization, quality systems
**Responsibilities:**
- Optimize system prompts for slide generation
- Design quality evaluation frameworks
- Implement feedback loops
- Test model outputs
- Research best practices

### 4. Management Consultant SME - Agent: consultant-sme
**Role:** Domain expert, quality reviewer, standards guardian
**Responsibilities:**
- Define consulting-grade slide standards
- Review slide outputs for quality
- Provide feedback on content structure
- Ensure MECE/Pyramid Principle compliance
- Benchmark against McKinsey/BCG/Bain standards

## Quality Standards Framework

### Tier 1: Structure (Must Have)
- [ ] Action titles (insight, not description)
- [ ] MECE structure (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive)
- [ ] Pyramid Principle (main point → arguments → data)
- [ ] Logical flow (top-down communication)

### Tier 2: Content (Must Have)
- [ ] Relevant data presented clearly
- [ ] So-what insights (not just what, but why it matters)
- [ ] Appropriate depth for audience
- [ ] No filler content

### Tier 3: Visual Design (Must Have)
- [ ] Clean, professional layout
- [ ] Consistent typography
- [ ] Appropriate use of color (teal/orange system)
- [ ] Clear visual hierarchy
- [ ] No design clutter

### Tier 4: Polish (Should Have)
- [ ] Grammar/spelling perfect
- [ ] Consistent terminology
- [ ] Source citations where appropriate
- [ ] Executive-ready formatting

## Communication Protocol

1. **CSO broadcasts task** → All agents receive context
2. **Agents work in parallel** → Specialized focus areas
3. **Agents report to CSO** → Findings, recommendations, outputs
4. **CSO synthesizes** → Makes decisions, assigns next tasks
5. **CSO reports to Blake** → Every 15 minutes with status
6. **Implementation** → FS engineer deploys approved changes

## Initial Work Plan (Hour 1)

### Phase 1 (0-15 min): Assessment & Standards
- CSO: Define exact quality criteria
- Consultant SME: Document McKinsey/BCG slide anatomy
- AI/ML: Audit current prompt and system
- FS: Review current UI/UX for friction points

### Phase 2 (15-30 min): Design Solutions
- CSO: Synthesize findings, prioritize improvements
- Consultant SME: Design quality rubric for slide evaluation
- AI/ML: Design enhanced prompt architecture
- FS: Design UI improvements for input/preview

### Phase 3 (30-45 min): Implementation Sprint
- CSO: Coordinate implementation priorities
- AI/ML: Implement enhanced prompts and quality checks
- FS: Implement UI/UX improvements
- Consultant SME: Test outputs against rubric

### Phase 4 (45-60 min): Testing & Refinement
- CSO: Review all outputs, final decisions
- All agents: Test end-to-end flow
- Document: Create quality playbook for future
- Deploy: Push improvements to production

## Success Metrics

1. **Quality Score:** 9+/10 on consultant rubric
2. **Consistency:** 95%+ slides meet standards first try
3. **Speed:** Generation time < 10 seconds
4. **User Satisfaction:** Blake approves quality

## Communication to Blake

Every 15 minutes, CSO will report:
- Current phase
- Agent progress
- Blockers (if any)
- Next 15-minute plan
- Any decisions needed
