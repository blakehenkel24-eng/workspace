> **Where SlideTheory can win — gaps, opportunities, and strategic advantages.**

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The consulting slide market is fragmented between template providers, slide databases, and education platforms. **No one has created a cohesive ecosystem** that combines all three with modern features and community.

**SlideTheory's Opportunity:** Become the "operating system for consulting presentations" — not just another template shop.
