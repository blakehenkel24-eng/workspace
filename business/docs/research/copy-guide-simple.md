# SlideTheory Copy Guide
**Simple, Logical, Insider-Resonant Website Copy**

---

## The Core Principle

**Speak like a tired consultant at 11pm, not a vendor trying to sound smart.**

Your audience spends their days in jargon. They want clarity, not more frameworks.

---

## 5 Rules

### 1. Lead With The Problem They Actually Have

**Don't:** "AI-powered slide generation for modern consultants"

**Do:** "Stop wrestling with PowerPoint at midnight"

**Why:** They're not looking for "AI" or "modern." They're looking to stop hurting.

---

### 2. Use Their Language, But Sparingly

**Insider terms that land:**
- "Deck" (not presentation)
- "So what?" (the key insight)
- "Version control hell" (Final_Final_v2.pptx)

**Don't overuse:**
- MECE, SCQA, Pyramid Principle (they know it, don't lecture)
- "Synergy," "paradigm," "leverage" (cringe words)

**Rule:** One or two insider terms per section. Let them feel seen, not sold to.

---

### 3. Be Specific About The Pain

**Weak:** "Save time on slides"

**Strong:** "3 half-finished layouts. Zero completed slides. Call in 10 minutes."

**Stronger:** "The analysis took an hour. Getting the structure right took all night."

**Why:** Specificity = credibility. Generic claims feel like marketing.

---

### 4. Acknowledge The Absurdity (Gently)

**Good:** "We know spending 40 hours on slides is ridiculous. So we built something better."

**Too much:** "Consulting is just PowerPoint and suffering lol"

**Why:** Self-aware humor works. Cynicism feels forced. You're helping, not mocking.

---

### 5. Show, Don't Tell

**Don't:** "Trusted by top consultants"

**Do:** "Associate, Bain" — "Consultant, BCG" — "Engagement Manager, Deloitte"

**Don't:** "AI-powered structure"

**Do:** "Paste your notes. Get the shell. Start building."

**Why:** Specific proof beats claims. Action beats adjectives.

---

## The Structure

### Hero Section
1. **Headline:** The outcome they want (not the feature)
2. **Subheadline:** The specific pain + how you solve it
3. **CTA:** Clear action
4. **Proof:** One line of social proof

**Example:**
```
Consultant-level slides in 30 seconds

You have the notes. You have the data. But now you're staring at 
a blank slide wondering if this should be a 2×2, a waterfall, 
or bullets.

Stop guessing. Paste what you have. Get the structure.

[Paste Your Notes → Get a Slide]

500+ consultants stopped fighting PowerPoint
```

---

### Problem Section
1. **The moment:** Set the scene (working late, deadline looming)
2. **The loop:** What they keep doing (delete, restart, repeat)
3. **The cost:** What it's actually taking from them

**Example:**
```
You drop a text box. Start typing. Realize this should be a 
column layout. Delete. Try again.

30 minutes later: three half-finished layouts, zero completed 
slides. And you have a call in 10 minutes.

The analysis took an hour. Getting the structure right is 
taking all night.
```

---

### Solution Section
1. **The shift:** What changes
2. **The steps:** 3 simple actions
3. **The result:** What they get

**Example:**
```
Paste what you have. Get an MBB slide.

1. Dump your notes
   Raw data, meeting notes, research—just paste it all.

2. Tell us the point  
   What's the one thing your audience should remember?

3. Get the structure
   MBB-quality framework. Professional chart. Ready to export.
```

### Before/After
| The Grind | With SlideTheory |
|-----------|------------------|
| Stare. Guess. Format. Repeat. | Paste. Click. Done. |
| 5th revision because "it doesn't flow" | Structure appears instantly |
| Wrestling with chart colors at 2am | MBB formatting—guaranteed |
| Still not sure this is "client-ready" | One-click regenerate if needed |

---

### Testimonials
Use real quotes from your research. Attribute to role + firm.

**What works:**
- Specific scenarios ("googling templates at 11pm")
- Emotional honesty ("Lost my thread completely")
- The transformation ("Game changer")

**What doesn't:**
- Generic praise ("Amazing tool!")
- No attribution
- Overly polished

---

## Words to Avoid

| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| AI-powered | [Don't mention AI unless asked] |
| Synergy | Nothing. Delete it. |
| Leverage | Use |
| Paradigm | Nothing. Delete it. |
| Best-in-class | [Specific proof] |
| Trusted by leading firms | "500+ consultants" + names |
| Solution | Tool, or just describe what it does |

---

## Tone Check

**Read your copy aloud. If it sounds like:**
- A McKinsey partner presenting → Too stiff
- A Twitter meme account → Too forced  
- A tired consultant explaining their Tuesday → Just right

---

## Quick Wins

1. **Change "presentation" to "deck"** everywhere
2. **Add one specific pain detail** (time, scenario, emotion)
3. **Remove 50% of adjectives** (amazing, powerful, best)
4. **Add one line of proof** (number + names)
5. **Read it at 11pm** — if it feels honest, ship it

---

## Final Test

**Ask yourself:** Would a consultant send this to a colleague with "this is literally us"?

If yes: You nailed it.
If no: Simplify. Be more specific. Cut the fluff.

---

**Remember:** You're not selling consulting. You're selling one less night of formatting slides.
