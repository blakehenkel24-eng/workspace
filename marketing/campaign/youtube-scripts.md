## Video 1: "Why Your Consulting Proposals Get Ignored"

**Target Length:** 8-10 minutes
**Target Keywords:** consulting proposal tips, proposal mistakes, consulting sales

### Script

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:30]**

*[Direct to camera, energetic]*

"Your consulting proposals are costing you thousands of dollars.

Not because of your pricing. Not because of your experience. But because of three mistakes you're probably making right now.

I'm going to show you exactly what they are — and how to fix them."

**[INTRO - 0:30-1:00]**

"I've spent the last decade helping consultants win over $50 million in engagements. And I've reviewed hundreds of proposals — the good, the bad, and the ones that never got read.

Today, I'm breaking down why most consulting proposals fail — and the simple fixes that can transform your close rate."

**[MISTAKE #1 - 1:00-3:00]**

**Mistake: Leading with credentials instead of the problem**

*[Screen share showing a typical proposal structure]*

"Look at this typical proposal structure. Page one: About us. Company history. Team bios. Credentials.

Here's the problem: Your prospect doesn't care.

They have an expensive problem keeping them up at night. And you're making them dig through five pages to find out if you understand it.

**The fix:** Start with THEIR problem. Articulate it better than they can. Show you understand the stakes, the urgency, the cost of inaction.

When you lead with understanding, you instantly separate yourself from 90% of competitors who lead with credentials."

*[Show side-by-side comparison of credential-first vs problem-first proposals]*

**[MISTAKE #2 - 3:00-5:00]**

**Mistake: The wall of text**

*[Screen share showing dense text proposal]*

"This is a proposal I received recently. Single-spaced. 12-point font. Pages of paragraphs.

Nobody's reading this.

Your prospect will spend maybe 60 seconds scanning your proposal before deciding whether to engage. If they see a wall of text, you've lost.

**The fix:** Visual hierarchy.

- Use headers that tell the story
- Break up text with bullet points
- Include white space
- Add visuals where possible

*[Show transformation: before/after]*

Same content. Completely different impact."

**[MISTAKE #3 - 5:00-7:00]**

**Mistake: Pricing by inputs instead of outcomes**

*[Screen share showing detailed price breakdown]*

"Phase 1: Research - $5,000. Phase 2: Analysis - $8,000. Phase 3: Recommendations - $7,000.

When you price like this, you're inviting your prospect to question every line item. To compare your hours to their internal costs. To focus on inputs instead of value.

**The fix:** Price by outcome.

Instead of "40 hours of research," try "A clear roadmap to $200,000 in annual savings."

Same price. Completely different conversation.

When you price by outcome, the fee becomes an investment, not a cost. ROI becomes obvious. And negotiation shifts from 'can you do it cheaper' to 'what results can we expect.'"

**[WRAP-UP - 7:00-8:30]**

"These three mistakes — leading with credentials, walls of text, and input-based pricing — cost consultants millions in lost revenue every year.

But they're easy to fix.

Lead with understanding. Use visual hierarchy. Price by outcome.

Do these three things, and you'll instantly separate yourself from the competition.

## Video 2: "How to Build a Consulting Portfolio That Sells"

**Target Length:** 10-12 minutes
**Target Keywords:** consulting portfolio, case studies, consulting marketing

### Script

---

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:30]**

"Here's a paradox that keeps consultants up at night:

Your best work is confidential. But clients want to see proof before they hire you.

So how do you build a portfolio when you can't show your portfolio?

Today, I'm sharing five strategies that actually work."

**[INTRO - 0:30-1:00]**

"I've been in consulting for over a decade. I've faced this problem myself. And I've helped hundreds of consultants navigate it.

The good news? You don't need to violate NDAs to prove your expertise.

Let me show you how."

**[STRATEGY #1 - 1:00-3:00]**

**Strategy: The Anonymous Case Study**

*[Screen share showing example case study]*

"A $500 million retail company was facing inventory challenges that were costing them $2 million annually. We conducted a comprehensive analysis, identified process bottlenecks, and implemented a new inventory management system.

Result: $1.8 million in annual savings within 12 months.

Notice what's missing? Names. Logos. Identifying details.

But does it establish credibility? Absolutely.

The key elements:
- Specific situation
- Your approach at a high level
- Quantified results
- Industry context

Your prospect gets proof of capability without you violating confidentiality."

**[STRATEGY #2 - 3:00-5:00]**

**Strategy: The Methodology Showcase**

*[Screen share showing framework diagram]*

"Sometimes showing HOW you think is more powerful than showing WHO you've worked with.

This is my framework for operational efficiency assessments. It shows:
- The phases I follow
- The questions I ask
- The outputs I deliver

Just from this diagram, prospects understand my approach, my thoroughness, and my professionalism.

The best part? Frameworks don't require client permission to share.

Document your methodologies. Systematize your approaches. Then share them generously.

Experts have frameworks. Amateurs wing it."

**[STRATEGY #3 - 5:00-6:30]**

**Strategy: The Before/After Pattern**

"Companies in this situation typically see X. We helped achieve Y.

This approach generalizes your experience into patterns that prospects recognize.

'Retailers with inventory challenges typically see 15% carrying cost overhead. Our clients average 8%.'

It's not about a specific client. It's about the pattern you've identified and solved.

This works especially well when you have a clear niche."

**[STRATEGY #4 - 6:30-8:00]**

**Strategy: The Thought Leadership Angle**

*[Screen share showing blog/article example]*

"Write so deeply about the problems you solve that your expertise becomes obvious.

Not surface-level "5 tips for efficiency" content. Deep, detailed analysis that only someone who's solved this problem twenty times could produce.

Case studies prove you did something once.
Thought leadership proves you understand something completely.

The portfolio becomes unnecessary."

**[STRATEGY #5 - 8:00-9:30]**

**Strategy: The Anonymized Testimonial**

"Sometimes, you can get permission for an anonymized quote.

'Director of Operations, Fortune 500 retailer' carries weight even without a name.

The key is asking specifically: 'Would you be comfortable with an anonymous testimonial?'

Many clients are happy to help, especially if you've delivered results."

**[WRAP-UP - 9:30-11:00]**

"The portfolio problem is real. But it's solvable.

Anonymous case studies. Methodology showcases. Before/after patterns. Thought leadership. Strategic testimonials.

Combine these approaches, and you'll build credibility without ever violating a confidence.

## Video 3: "Pricing Psychology: How to Present Your Consulting Fees"

**Target Length:** 9-11 minutes
**Target Keywords:** consulting pricing, fee negotiation, value-based pricing

### Script

---

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:30]**

"The exact moment your client decides your price is 'too high' has nothing to do with your price.

It has to do with how you present it.

Today, I'm breaking down the pricing psychology that separates $10K consultants from $100K consultants."

**[INTRO - 0:30-1:00]**

"I used to compete on price. Then I learned something that changed everything.

I raised my rates 400%. And my close rate stayed roughly the same.

Here's what I learned about pricing psychology."

**[THE PROBLEM - 1:00-2:30]**

*[Screen share showing traditional price breakdown]*

"Most consultants present pricing like this:

Phase 1: Research - $5,000
Phase 2: Strategy - $8,000
Phase 3: Implementation - $7,000
Total: $20,000

Seems logical, right? Transparent. Honest.

Also: completely wrong.

When you break down pricing by phase, you invite your prospect to:
- Question every line item
- Negotiate each phase separately
- Compare your hours to their internal costs
- Focus on inputs instead of outcomes

You've shifted the conversation from value to cost."

**[PRINCIPLE #1 - 2:30-4:00]**

**Principle: Price by Outcome**

"What if instead, you presented:

Investment: $20,000
Outcome: A clear roadmap to $200,000 in annual savings

Same price. Completely different conversation.

When you price by outcome:
- The fee becomes an investment, not a cost
- ROI becomes obvious
- Negotiation shifts from 'can you do it cheaper' to 'what results can we expect'

This is the single biggest shift you can make in your pricing."

**[PRINCIPLE #2 - 4:00-5:30]**

**Principle: Single Price Point**

"Options create decision paralysis.

The Bronze/Silver/Gold approach works for SaaS. It doesn't work for consulting.

When you give options, you're asking the client to become an expert in your services to decide what's appropriate. They don't have enough information.

Instead: One clear price for one clear outcome.

If they need something different, that's a conversation, not a menu selection."

**[PRINCIPLE #3 - 5:30-7:00]**

**Principle: Use Investment Language**

"Words matter.

'Your investment' not 'Our fee'
'Partnership' not 'Contract'
'Value delivered' not 'Hours worked'

These aren't just word games. They reframe the entire relationship.

'Fee' implies a transaction. 'Investment' implies a return.
'Contract' implies obligation. 'Partnership' implies collaboration.

Small words. Massive impact."

**[THE CONFIDENCE FACTOR - 7:00-8:30]**

"Here's the counterintuitive part: Raising your price often increases your close rate.

Why?

Because price signals confidence.

A consultant who charges $20,000 confidently signals more expertise than one who charges $15,000 apologetically.

Most consultants undercharge not because they're not worth more, but because they present their value poorly.

Fix the presentation. Fix the pricing power."

**[PRACTICAL EXAMPLE - 8:30-9:30]**

*[Screen share showing SlideTheory pricing slide template]*

"Here's what a high-converting pricing slide looks like:

[Show example]

- Outcome front and center
- Investment clearly stated
- ROI calculation included
- Payment terms that work for both parties
- Clear next steps

This format has closed millions in consulting engagements."

**[WRAP-UP - 9:30-10:30]**

"Pricing psychology isn't about manipulation. It's about alignment.

Aligning your presentation with the value you deliver. Helping prospects see the investment, not just the expense.

Remember:
- Price by outcome
- Single price point
- Use investment language
- Present with confidence

Do these four things, and you'll transform your pricing power.
