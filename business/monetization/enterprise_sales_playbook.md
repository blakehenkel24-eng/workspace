## Common Objections & Responses

### Pricing Objections

**"You're more expensive than PowerPoint/Google Slides"**
```
"I understand price is a consideration. Let me ask—how much 
time does your team spend formatting slides in PowerPoint?

If SLIDETHEORY saves each designer 5 hours/week at $75/hour, 
that's $19,500/year per person in productivity gains.

For a team of 10, that's $195,000 in value for a $30,000 
investment."
```

**"We need a bigger discount"**
```
"I can explore additional flexibility. What I'm able to offer 
depends on a few things:

• Contract length (2-3 year terms get better rates)
• Annual prepayment (improves our discounting ability)
• Case study participation (helps us justify exceptions)
• Expansion commitment (guaranteed growth)

Which of these might work for your situation?"
```

### Technical Objections

**"We need on-premise deployment"**
```
"Most enterprises initially ask for on-premise. What specific 
concerns are driving that requirement?

[Listen for: data residency, security, control]

Our cloud deployment can address those:
• Data residency: EU, US, or custom region options
• Security: SOC 2 Type II, encryption at rest/transit
• Control: Admin controls, audit logs, retention policies

Would a dedicated single-tenant instance address your needs?"
```

**"How do you handle SSO and provisioning?"**
```
"We integrate with all major identity providers:
• SAML 2.0 (Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin)
• SCIM for automated user provisioning
• Just-in-time provisioning for new users

Our implementation team handles the full setup, typically 
completed within 2 weeks. Would you like to see a technical 
architecture diagram?"
```

### Process Objections

**"This needs to go through procurement/RFP"**
```
"Absolutely, that's standard for an investment of this size. 
To help you prepare:

• I can provide our standard security documentation
• We have an RFP response template ready
• Our legal team can review your terms
• We can do a pilot to build internal support

Who else should I connect with to ensure this moves smoothly?"
```

**"We need to evaluate other options"**
```
"Of course—due diligence is important. Most of our customers 
evaluated [Competitor A] and [Competitor B] as well.

Here's what they found:
• [Competitor A] has [limitation]
• [Competitor B] doesn't offer [key feature]

What specific capabilities are you comparing? I want to make 
sure you have accurate information."
```
