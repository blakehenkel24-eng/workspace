## Quick Start

### Step 1: Open SlideTheory

Navigate to [slidetheory.io](https://slidetheory.io) in your web browser. The app works best in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.

### Step 2: Select a Slide Type

Click the dropdown under **"Slide Type"** and choose from:

| Slide Type | Best For |
|------------|----------|
| **Executive Summary** | High-level overviews, board presentations |
| **Horizontal Flow** | Process flows, timelines, step-by-step |
| **Vertical Flow** | Org charts, hierarchies, decision trees |
| **Graph/Chart** | Data visualization, metrics, KPIs |
| **General** | Flexible layouts for custom needs |

**Tip:** Not sure which to pick? Start with **General** — it offers the most flexibility.

### Step 3: Select Your Audience

Choose who you're presenting to:

- **C-Suite/Board** — High-level summaries, minimal detail
- **External Client** — Professional, polished visuals
- **Internal/Working Team** — Detailed, collaborative style
- **PE/Investors** — Data-heavy, metrics-focused

This setting automatically adjusts whitespace and detail level to match expectations.

### Step 4: Write Your Key Takeaway

Enter the single most important message in the **Key Takeaway** field.

**Good examples:**
- ✅ "Revenue growth of 25% YoY positions us for a successful Series B"
- ✅ "Three strategic pivots are required to capture the $2B market opportunity"
- ✅ "Customer acquisition costs have decreased 40% while LTV increased 60%"

**Avoid:**
- ❌ "Q3 Results" (too vague)
- ❌ Multiple messages in one sentence
- ❌ Jargon without context

### Step 5: Add Context

The **Context** field is where you provide background information. Be specific:

```
Our SaaS company serves mid-market B2B customers. 
Current ARR is $4.2M with 68% gross margins.
We expanded from 3 to 5 product lines this year.
Primary competitors are legacy players with 12+ month sales cycles.
```

**Tips for great context:**
- Include 3-5 key facts
- Mention competitive landscape if relevant
- Note any recent changes (acquisitions, pivots, expansions)
- Keep it under 2000 characters

### Step 6: (Optional) Add Data

If you have specific metrics, paste them in the **Data Input** field:

```
Revenue:	$5.2M (+23%)
Customers:	1,240 (+45%)
Gross Margin:	68% (+4pp)
CAC:		$1,200 (-15%)
LTV:		$14,400 (+22%)
```

You can also upload CSV or Excel files — SlideTheory will parse the data automatically.

### Step 7: Generate Your Slide

Click the **"Generate Slide"** button or press **Ctrl + Enter**.

You'll see a loading state with progress updates:
1. Analyzing context...
2. Structuring content...
3. Designing slide...
4. Finalizing...

Generation typically takes 3-5 seconds.

### Step 8: Review and Download

Once generated, your slide appears in the preview panel. You can:

- **Regenerate** — Try again with the same inputs (Ctrl + R)
- **Download PNG** — High-resolution image
- **Download PPTX** — Editable PowerPoint file
- **Download PDF** — Print-ready document

## Understanding Slide Types

### Executive Summary

**Structure:** Title + Key Points + Recommendation

**Best for:**
- Board meetings
- Investor updates
- Project kickoffs
- Final recommendations

**Example prompt:**
> "Series B fundraising overview. We grew revenue 150% to $8M ARR. Customer count doubled to 2,400. Gross margins improved from 62% to 71%. Seeking $15M to expand sales team and enter Europe."

### Horizontal Flow

**Structure:** Left-to-right process flow with 3-5 steps

**Best for:**
- Process maps
- Customer journeys
- Implementation timelines
- Decision workflows

**Example prompt:**
> "Customer onboarding process: 1) Sign contract, 2) Technical integration (1 week), 3) Data migration (2 weeks), 4) Training sessions (3 sessions), 5) Go-live support (30 days)."

### Vertical Flow

**Structure:** Top-down hierarchy or tree structure

**Best for:**
- Org charts
- Decision trees
- Issue trees (MECE)
- Value chains

**Example prompt:**
> "Root cause of churn: Product issues (30%), Onboarding gaps (25%), Pricing concerns (20%), Competitive pressure (15%), Other (10%)."

### Graph/Chart

**Structure:** Data visualization with annotations

**Best for:**
- Financial metrics
- Market sizing
- Trend analysis
- Performance dashboards

**Example prompt:**
> "Q1-Q4 revenue progression: Q1: $2.1M, Q2: $2.6M (+24%), Q3: $3.1M (+19%), Q4: $3.7M (+19%). Target was $3.5M for Q4."

## Writing Effective Context

The quality of your slide depends heavily on the context you provide. Follow these principles:

### The 5-Question Framework

Answer these in your context:

1. **What is the situation?** (current state)
2. **What's the complication?** (problem or opportunity)
3. **What's the key question?** (what decision is needed)
4. **What are the options?** (alternatives considered)
5. **What's the recommendation?** (proposed path forward)

### Example: Good vs. Poor Context

**Poor:**
```
We need to present our Q3 results to the board.
```

**Good:**
```
Q3 financial results presentation for board review.
Revenue: $4.2M (+23% YoY, +8% QoQ)
Key drivers: Enterprise segment growth (+45%), new product launch success
Challenges: SMB churn increased to 4.5% (from 3.2%)
Decision needed: Approve $500K investment in customer success team
Competitive context: Two major competitors raised pricing, creating opportunity
```

## Adding Data Points

### Format Options

**Inline text:**
```
Revenue grew 23% to $4.2M
```

**Tabular format (recommended):**
```
Metric:		Value:		Change:
Revenue:	$4.2M:		+23%
Customers:	1,240:		+45%
Gross Margin:	68%:		+4pp
```

**Bullet points:**
```
• Revenue: $4.2M (+23% YoY)
• Customers: 1,240 (+45%)
• Gross Margin: 68% (+4pp)
• CAC: $1,200 (-15%)
• LTV: $14,400 (+22%)
```

### Best Practices

1. **Be consistent** — Use the same format throughout
2. **Include context** — Always show % change, not just absolute numbers
3. **Round numbers** — "~$4M" is often clearer than "$4,247,892"
4. **Limit to 5-7 metrics** — Too many data points overwhelm

## Preview and Export

### Understanding Your Preview

The preview panel shows exactly how your slide will look. Check for:

- **Text readability** — Is everything legible?
- **Visual hierarchy** — Is the most important information prominent?
- **Whitespace** — Does it feel cluttered or spacious?
- **Data accuracy** — Are numbers and labels correct?

### Export Options

| Format | Best For | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **PNG** | Embedding in docs, email | High-res, 1920×1080 |
| **PPTX** | Editing in PowerPoint | Fully editable text |
| **PDF** | Printing, formal distribution | Vector quality |

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Speed up your workflow with these shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl + Enter` | Generate slide |
| `Ctrl + R` | Regenerate slide |
| `Ctrl + D` | Download slide |
| `?` | Show keyboard shortcuts |
| `Esc` | Close modal / Cancel generation |

## Tips for Best Results

### Do:

✅ Be specific with numbers and percentages
✅ Include competitive context when relevant
✅ Use the audience selector to match style
✅ Try regenerating if the first result isn't perfect
✅ Save your best prompts for reuse

### Don't:

❌ Use jargon without explanation
❌ Include more than one key message
❌ Paste entire documents into the context field
❌ Expect perfection on the first try — iterate!

### Pro Tips

1. **Iterate quickly** — Generate, review, adjust context, regenerate
2. **Save templates** — Found a great prompt? Save it for next time
3. **Use presentation mode** — For live talks, less text is more
4. **Preview on mobile** — Check how your slide looks on phone screens

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Generation failed" error

- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page
- Reduce context length (keep under 1500 characters)

### Slide looks wrong

- Try regenerating with the same inputs
- Adjust your context to be more specific
- Try a different slide type

### Download doesn't work

- Check browser permissions
- Try a different format (PNG usually most reliable)
- Disable ad blockers temporarily

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your first slide:

1. **Explore templates** — Try the pre-built templates for common scenarios
2. **Build a deck** — Create multiple slides and download as PPTX
3. **Share feedback** — Help us improve by reporting issues or suggesting features

Happy presenting! 🎯
