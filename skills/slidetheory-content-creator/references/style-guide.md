# SlideTheory Writing Style Guide

## Voice & Tone

### Credibility Markers
- Always establish authority: "former consultant", "based on experience at McKinsey/BCG/Bain"
- Use first-person when sharing expertise: "In my years at...", "I learned that..."
- Reference real consulting frameworks and methodologies
- Include disclaimers: "Disclaimer: SlideTheory is independent and not affiliated with..."

### Writing Style
- **Direct and practical**: No fluff, every sentence adds value
- **Action-oriented**: Use verbs like "implement", "initiate", "transform", "craft"
- **Consulting-grade**: Professional but accessible
- **Evidence-based**: Support claims with frameworks, examples, or logic

### Structure Template

Every piece follows this flow:

```
1. HOOK (Why this matters)
   - Connect to business outcome
   - Establish stakes

2. WHAT (Definition/Explanation)
   - Clear, concise definition
   - Differentiate from similar concepts

3. WHY (Importance)
   - Business impact
   - When to use this

4. HOW (Step-by-step)
   - Numbered framework
   - Actionable instructions
   - Best practices

5. EXAMPLES (Real-world)
   - Before/after comparisons
   - Consulting firm examples (McKinsey, BCG, Bain style)
   - Screenshots or slide mockups

6. TEMPLATE/TOOL (Free resource)
   - SlideTheory template
   - Checklist
   - Framework diagram
```
