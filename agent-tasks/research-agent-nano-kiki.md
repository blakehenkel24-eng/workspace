# Agent Task: Nano Banana & Kiki Code Research

**Source:** Todoist Task #9988951764
**Original Task:** "Learn how to use nano banana or Kiki code generate AI powered slides / images of slides"

## Objective
Research nano banana and Kiki code tools for AI-powered slide/image generation and document findings.

## Deliverables
1. Create `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/memory/ai-slide-tools-research.md`
2. Research both tools:
   - What are they? (APIs, libraries, SaaS?)
   - How do they work?
   - Pricing/models available
   - Integration options
   - Code examples for slide generation
   - Comparison of both tools

## Questions to Answer
- Can these generate presentation slides programmatically?
- What formats do they support (PPTX, PDF, images)?
- How do they compare to alternatives (Gamma, Beautiful.ai API, etc.)?
- Are there self-hosted options?

Report back with findings and recommendations for SlideTheory.
