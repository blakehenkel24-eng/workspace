## POST 1: The Origin Story
**Theme:** "I built this because I was tired of..."  
**Day:** Launch Day (Tuesday)  
**Time:** 9:00 AM ET  
**Format:** Single tweet

```
I built SlideTheory because I was tired of watching consultants spend 40+ hours on slides that could take 4.

The same layouts. The same frameworks. The same "let me format this in PowerPoint" grind.

So I'm automating the boring stuff so we can focus on the thinking.

What SlideTheory does:

→ Generates McKinsey-style frameworks in seconds
→ Formats data into executive-ready visuals
→ Handles the design so you handle the strategy

Not replacing consultants. 

Removing the friction that keeps us from doing real work.

Beta open soon. Follow along if this resonates.

## POST 2: The Problem
**Theme:** "Consultants spend X hours on slides..."  
**Day:** Day 2 (Wednesday)  
**Time:** 9:00 AM ET  
**Format:** Single tweet with image opportunity

```
Consultants spend 60% of their time formatting slides.

Not analyzing. Not strategizing. 

Formatting.

Font sizes. Color palettes. Aligning boxes. Wrestling with PowerPoint.

The irony? The thinking that matters gets rushed because the deck is due.

What if that ratio was flipped?

## POST 3: The Solution
**Theme:** "What if AI could..."  
**Day:** Day 3 (Thursday)  
**Time:** 12:00 PM ET  
**Format:** Single tweet with hook question

```
What if AI could handle the slide work so you could focus on the strategy work?

Not writing your analysis.
Not replacing your judgment.

Just the tedious parts:
→ Building framework layouts
→ Formatting data tables
→ Consistent branding across 100+ slides

That's SlideTheory.

DM "beta" if you want early access.
