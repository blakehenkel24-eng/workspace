## What Are Claude Custom Projects?

Claude Custom Projects are specialized AI workspaces that you can configure with specific instructions, context, and knowledge bases. Unlike standard AI chats, Custom Projects remember your preferences, follow consistent frameworks, and produce output tailored to your exact needs.

Think of them as dedicated AI assistants for specific workflows—each trained on your methodologies, client requirements, and preferred formats.

**Key differences from standard AI chat:**
- **Persistent context**: Projects remember your frameworks and preferences
- **Custom instructions**: Define exactly how Claude should approach each task
- **Knowledge bases**: Upload SOW templates, past proposals, client guidelines
- **Consistent output**: Same quality and format every time
- **Collaboration**: Share projects with team members

## Why Custom Projects Are a Game-Changer for Consultants

The average consultant spends 15-20 hours per week on document creation, reviews, and administrative tasks. Custom Projects can reduce this by 60-70% while improving quality and consistency.

**Business impact:**
- **Time savings**: 10+ hours per week reclaimed for high-value analysis
- **Quality consistency**: Every deliverable follows your best practices
- **Faster turnaround**: SOWs and proposals that took days now take hours
- **Reduced errors**: AI catches inconsistencies and missing elements
- **Knowledge retention**: Institutional knowledge captured in project settings

**When to use Custom Projects:**
- Repetitive document creation (SOWs, proposals, reports)
- Client-specific work requiring consistent formatting
- Team collaboration on standardized deliverables
- Complex workflows requiring multiple steps
- High-volume periods (RFP season, year-end reviews)

## How to Set Up Your First Custom Project

### Step 1: Define Your Workflow

Before creating the project, map out:
- What specific task are you automating?
- What inputs do you provide?
- What outputs do you need?
- What format/style is required?
- What are common mistakes to avoid?

**Example - SOW Workflow:**
- Inputs: Client name, project scope, timeline, team structure
- Output: Professional SOW document
- Format: Your firm's template
- Style: Executive summary + detailed sections
- Avoid: Vague scope descriptions, missing assumptions

### Step 2: Create the Project

1. Go to [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and click "Create Project"
2. Name it clearly (e.g., "SOW Drafting Assistant")
3. Add a description of what the project does

### Step 3: Write Custom Instructions

This is the most critical step. Your instructions should include:

**Role Definition:**
```
You are an expert consultant with 10+ years of experience at top-tier 
firms (McKinsey, BCG, Bain). You specialize in writing clear, 
professional Statements of Work that win engagements.
```

**Framework/Process:**
```
Follow this structure for every SOW:
1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
2. Background & Objectives
3. Scope of Work (be specific and MECE)
4. Approach & Methodology
5. Deliverables
6. Timeline & Milestones
7. Team Structure
8. Assumptions & Dependencies
9. Commercial Terms
10. Next Steps
```

**Tone & Style:**
```
- Professional but accessible
- Specific and actionable (avoid vague language)
- Client-focused (emphasize value and outcomes)
- Use active voice
- Include concrete examples where helpful
```

**Quality Standards:**
```
Before finalizing, check:
- [ ] Scope is specific and measurable
- [ ] All assumptions are listed
- [ ] Timeline is realistic
- [ ] Commercial terms are clear
- [ ] No placeholder text remains
```

### Step 4: Upload Knowledge Base

Add relevant documents:
- Past SOWs (high-quality examples)
- Firm templates
- Client guidelines or preferences
- Pricing frameworks
- Industry benchmarks

**Best practice:** Include 3-5 examples of your best work so Claude understands your style.

### Step 5: Test and Iterate

Start with a simple test case:
1. Provide basic inputs
2. Review the output
3. Give specific feedback
4. Refine the instructions
5. Repeat until output matches your standards

**Benefit:** Consistent thought leadership without the time drain

## Best Practices from Top Consulting Firms

### 1. Start with High-Volume, Low-Complexity Tasks

Don't try to automate your most complex deliverables first. Start with:
- Weekly status updates
- Meeting agendas
- Email drafts
- Simple research summaries

Build confidence and refine your approach before tackling proposals and strategic documents.

### 2. Invest Time in Instructions Up Front

Spending 30 minutes writing detailed custom instructions saves 5+ hours per week later. Be specific about:
- Format requirements
- Tone preferences
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Quality checklists

### 3. Use the "Show, Don't Tell" Approach

Instead of describing what you want, upload 3-5 examples of your best work. Claude will match the style, structure, and quality level.

### 4. Create Client-Specific Projects

For your top 3-5 clients, create dedicated projects with:
- Their brand guidelines
- Key stakeholder information
- Past deliverables for reference
- Specific terminology they use

This ensures consistency and reduces context-switching.

### 5. Iterate Based on Feedback

Treat your first outputs as drafts. Give Claude specific feedback:
- "Make the executive summary shorter"
- "Add more specific metrics"
- "Use a more formal tone for this client"

The project improves with each interaction.

### 6. Maintain Human Oversight

AI accelerates your work but doesn't replace judgment. Always:
- Review outputs for accuracy
- Add strategic insights AI can't generate
- Customize for specific client situations
- Check for hallucinations or outdated information
