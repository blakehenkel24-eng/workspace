## SlideTheory v2.0 — Multi-Agent Build Sprint COMPLETE ✅

**Date:** 2026-02-05
**Status:** Improvement Cycle 1 Complete, Cycle 2 Launching

### What Was Built

**Initial v2.0 MVP (5 parallel agents):**
1. ✅ **Design Agent** — Modern McKinsey-style UI with all input fields
2. ✅ **Product Manager** — Specs, API docs, roadmap, integration plan
3. ✅ **Prompt Engineer** — AI generation pipeline with retry logic
4. ✅ **Architect** — Modular, scalable code structure
5. ✅ **QA Engineer** — 81 tests passing, bug tracking, manual checklist

**Knowledge Base Created:**
- 4 MBB-inspired templates extracted from McKinsey decks
- Executive Summary, Trend Analysis, Timeline, Market Comparison layouts
- Structural patterns only (no content extraction)

### Critical Discovery: AI Text Legibility

**BLOCKER IDENTIFIED:** Kimi K2.5 cannot reliably render legible text in generated images.

**SOLUTION (Cycle 1):** Hybrid Renderer
- AI generates slide background/layout (no text)
- Canvas/SVG overlays programmatic text
- Text is crisp, legible, professionally rendered
- Successfully tested with 10 slides

### Improvement Cycle 1 Results

| Deliverable | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Hybrid renderer prototype | ✅ Complete |
| Real progress tracking (SSE) | ✅ Complete |
| Spec drift cleanup | ✅ Complete |
| Mobile UX redesign spec | 📝 Ready for Cycle 2 |
| Accessibility improvements spec | 📝 Ready for Cycle 2 |

### Key Decisions

1. **AI approach:** Hybrid (AI layout + programmatic text) — NOT pure AI generation
2. **Auto-commit:** Enabled — all changes pushed automatically without asking
3. **Workflow:** 5 parallel agents → Retro → 5 improvement cycles → Documentation
4. **Target:** Near-perfect v2 after 5 cycles, then comprehensive documentation

### Next Steps

- **Cycle 2:** Mobile UX stepper + Accessibility improvements
- **Cycles 3-5:** TBD based on retro findings
- **Final:** Process flows, architecture docs, features → Google Drive

### Auto-Commit Confirmed

All code changes are automatically committed and pushed. No permission requests needed.

### Learnings

- Multi-agent parallel development is highly effective for complex features
- AI image generation has fundamental text legibility limitations (not implementation issues)
- Retrospectives surface critical blockers early
- Hybrid AI + traditional rendering is the pragmatic path forward
