Yes. We use industry-standard encryption:
- TLS 1.3 for all connections
- Data encrypted at rest (AES-256)
- No data sold to third parties

**Anonymous users:** Content is processed but not stored after generation.

**Logged-in users:** Slide history is saved for your convenience. You can delete individual slides or your entire history at any time.

### Can I use confidential client data?

For highly sensitive data, we recommend:
1. Using anonymized or placeholder data

## Troubleshooting

### Generation fails with "Error 429"

**Cause:** Rate limit exceeded.

**Solution:** 
- Free (no account): 5 slides/hour limit — wait or create account
- Free (account): 20 slides/hour limit — wait 1 hour
- Pro: 100 slides/hour limit — contact us if you need more

### Slide text is cut off or unreadable

**Try:**
1. Reducing context length (aim for under 1500 characters)
2. Using fewer data points (5-7 maximum)
3. Switching slide types
4. Regenerating the slide

### The generated slide doesn't match my request

**Tips:**
- Be more specific in your context
- Use concrete numbers instead of vague descriptions
- Try a different slide type
- Regenerate 2-3 times and pick the best result

### Downloads won't start

**Check:**
1. Disable ad blockers for slidetheory.io
2. Check browser download permissions
3. Try a different browser
4. Clear browser cache and retry

### Mobile view looks different from desktop

The preview panel adapts to your screen size. For the most accurate preview, use desktop at 100% zoom.

### "Something went wrong" error

**Try these in order:**
1. Refresh the page and retry
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Try an incognito/private window

## Best Practices

### How do I get the best results?

1. **Be specific** — Include numbers, percentages, and concrete details
2. **Know your audience** — Use the audience selector
3. **Iterate** — Generate 2-3 versions and pick the best
4. **Keep it simple** — 5-7 data points is the sweet spot
5. **Use templates** — Start with pre-built templates for common scenarios

### Can SlideTheory replace my designer?

SlideTheory excels at rapid iteration and standard consulting formats. For highly customized visual designs or brand-specific illustrations, you'll still want a designer.

### How accurate is the AI?

The AI structures content using proven consulting frameworks (Pyramid Principle, MECE, etc.). However:
- Always verify data accuracy
- Review for context appropriateness
- Fact-check any claims or statistics
