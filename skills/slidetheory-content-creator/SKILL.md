# SlideTheory Content Creator

Create high-quality, consulting-grade content for SlideTheory that attracts strategy consultants and drives signups.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when Blake requests:
- Blog posts on consulting topics
- LinkedIn or Twitter content
- Newsletter copy
- Lead magnets (templates, checklists, guides)
- Resource page content
- Case studies
- SEO-targeted articles

## Content Philosophy

**Based on SlideWorks.io style:**
- Written by "former consultants" (establish credibility)
- Practical, step-by-step frameworks
- Real examples from McKinsey, BCG, Bain
- Free templates included
- SEO-optimized for consulting keywords
- Actionable and immediately useful

**Voice:** Professional, authoritative, but accessible. Like a senior consultant mentoring a junior.

## How to Create Content

### Step 1: Understand the Topic
Ask Blake (if needed):
- What specific topic or problem?
- Target audience (junior vs senior consultants?)
- Content type (blog, LinkedIn, template, etc.)
- Any specific examples or angles?

### Step 2: Read Reference Materials

**Required reading before writing:**
1. `references/style-guide.md` — Voice, tone, structure
2. `references/templates.md` — Templates for each content type
3. `references/topic-ideas.md` — Content categories and SEO strategy

### Step 3: Create Content

Follow the appropriate template from `references/templates.md`:

| Content Type | Template | Length |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| Blog Post | Full guide | 1,500-2,500 words |
| LinkedIn | Short insight | 150-200 words |
| Twitter/X | Thread (5-7 tweets) | 50-100 words/tweet |
| Newsletter | Weekly insight | 300-500 words |
| Lead Magnet | Template description | 200-300 words |
| Case Study | Results-focused | 400-600 words |

### Step 4: Apply Style Rules

**From style-guide.md:**
- Start with credibility: "Based on experience from McKinsey, BCG, and Bain..."
- Use action verbs: implement, initiate, transform, craft
- Include consulting frameworks: MECE, Pyramid Principle, etc.
- Add disclaimer: "SlideTheory is independent and not affiliated with..."
- End with CTA and free template
- Include 3-7 real examples

### Step 5: SEO Optimization

**Include these keywords naturally:**
- Primary: consulting presentations, strategy decks, slide templates, McKinsey slides
- Secondary: action titles, MECE principle, pyramid principle, executive presentations

**Structure for SEO:**
- H1: Main keyword
- H2: Related keywords
- First 100 words: Primary keyword
- Internal links to related content
- Meta description: 155 characters with keywords

**You do:**
1. Read `style-guide.md` for voice/tone
2. Read `templates.md` for blog post structure
3. Check `topic-ideas.md` for related topics to link
4. Write using the blog post template
5. Include: definition, importance, 5-step framework, 3 examples, free template
6. Save to `content-output/blog-posts/2026-02-08-action-titles-guide.md`
7. Return to Blake with file path and summary
