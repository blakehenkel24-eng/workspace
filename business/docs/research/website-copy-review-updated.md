# SlideTheory Website Copy Review & Recommendations

**Review Date:** February 7, 2026  
**Current Status:** Significantly improved from original — pain-focused, authentic voice, good structure

---

## Overall Assessment

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Pain-first messaging (structure is the hardest part)
- ✅ Authentic consultant language (MBB, 2×2, issue tree)
- ✅ Specific testimonials with firm names
- ✅ Before/After contrast is clear
- ✅ "Paste Your Notes → Get a Slide" CTA is action-oriented

**Areas for Refinement:**
- Some phrases could be punchier
- Testimonials are strong but could be curated for narrative arc
- Pricing page benefits could be more compelling
- Minor flow issues in the problem section

## Section-by-Section Review

### 1. Hero Section

**Current:**
```
Consultant-level slides in 30 seconds

You have the notes. You have the data. But now you're staring at a 
blank slide wondering:"Should this be a 2×2? A waterfall? 
Bullets?"Stop guessing at structure. Paste what you have. Get the 
shell. Start building.

Paste Your Notes → Get a Slide

500+ consultants stopped fighting PowerPoint
```

**Recommended:**

[Paste Your Notes → Get a Slide]

500+ consultants stopped fighting PowerPoint
```

**Changes:**
- Fixed spacing issue after "wondering:" — the quote should be separate
- Removed extra line break before CTA
- Keep the "stopped fighting PowerPoint" — that's strong

### 2. Problem Section — "The structure is the hardest part"

**Current:**
```
You drop a box on the slide. Start typing your notes. Realize this 
should be a column layout. Delete. Try again.

30 minutes later: three half-finished layouts, zero completed slides. 
And you have a call in 10 minutes.

You know what you want to say. You just don't know how to structure 
it. Should this be a 2×2? An issue tree? A comparison table?

So you google "consulting slide templates" and fall down a rabbit 
hole of 2014 PDFs that don't even open properly.

The analysis took an hour. Getting the structure right is taking all 
night.

**Notes:**
- Keep this section as-is — the narrative flow is excellent
- The stats add credibility and specificity
- Consider adding a subtle visual divider before the stats

**Current:**

messy notes and get a professionally structured slide—every time.

   all in. The AI reads everything.

2. Tell it your point
   What's the one thing your audience should remember? This becomes 
   your action title and drives the entire structure.

3. Get a finished slide
   Instant MBB-quality structure. Professional chart. Clean insights. 
   Ready to export or iterate in one click.

### 4. Before vs. After Section

**Current:**
```
Before vs. After SlideTheory

THE GRIND                           WITH SLIDETHEORY
Stare. Guess. Format. Repeat.       Paste. Click. Done.

• Blank slide staring back at you    ✓ Structure appears instantly
• Wrestling with chart colors at 2am ✓ Charts look like Excel (in a good way)
• 5th revision because "it doesn't flow" ✓ MBB formatting—guaranteed
• Formatting takes longer than the analysis ✓ Focus on insights, not margins
• Still not sure if this is "MBB quality" ✓ One-click regenerate if needed
```

```

**Changes:**
- Minor tightening: "takes longer than analysis" vs "takes longer than the analysis"
- "Still not sure this is" vs "Still not sure if this is" — more punchy

### 5. Testimonials Section

**Current:**
```
Real friction. Real relief.

"I'd drop some boxes on the slide, start filling in my notes, then 
realize the structure was all wrong. Rearrange. Delete. Start over. 
Three hours later I had... a title and two bullets."
— Associate, Bain

"Constant context switching is the killer. I'd get 20 minutes into a 
slide, jump on a call, come back and stare at the screen like 'what 
was I even doing here?' Lost my thread completely."
— Consultant, BCG

"The worst is googling 'consulting slide templates' at 11pm. You find 
some PDF from 2014, try to reverse-engineer it, give up, and just make 
another bullet slide. Partner hates it. You knew they would."
— Engagement Manager, Deloitte

"I know what I want to say. I have all the data. But I don't know if 
this should be a 2×2, an issue tree, or just... bullets? The 
indecision paralyzes me for an hour."
— Senior Consultant, Kearney

"My process was: open PowerPoint, add a title, add a text box, type 
some stuff, hate it, close PowerPoint, open it again, repeat. 
SlideTheory breaks that loop."
— Analyst, McKinsey

"Now I paste my messy notes, get a structure that actually makes sense, 
and I have something to iterate on. The shell is there. I just fill 
it in. Game changer."
— Associate, Bain

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Add a "How It Works" Visual/GIF
Between the 3-step solution and Before/After, consider adding:
- A 10-second GIF showing: paste notes → AI processing → slide appears
- Or a side-by-side: messy input vs clean output

### 2. Add Social Proof Above Fold
Move "500+ consultants stopped fighting PowerPoint" closer to the headline, or add:
```
★★★★★ Trusted by consultants from McKinsey, BCG, Bain, Deloitte, Kearney
```

### 3. Consider Adding These Sections

**"Built by a consultant, for consultants"**
```
I spent 3 years at [Firm] making slides at 2am. 
I built SlideTheory because I couldn't find a tool that 
actually understood the consulting workflow.

— Blake, Founder
```

**"The MBB Standard"**
```
Your slides follow the same frameworks used at McKinsey, 
Bain, and BCG:

• Action titles that state the insight
• MECE structure  
• Pyramid principle
• So-what driven logic

No more wondering if your deck is "client-ready."
```

**FAQ Section**
```
Q: Will my firm know I'm using AI?
A: They'll just think you're really good at PowerPoint.

Q: Can I edit the slides after?
A: Yes — export as PNG or copy the structure to PowerPoint.

Q: Is this just another AI template tool?
A: No. Templates are rigid. SlideTheory adapts to your content 
   and picks the right structure dynamically.
```

### 4. Microcopy Improvements

**Button hover states:**
- "Paste Your Notes → Get a Slide" could show tooltip: 
  "Takes 30 seconds. No credit card required."

**Loading state:**
If there's a processing screen:
```
Reading your notes...
Finding the right structure...
Building your slide...
Applying MBB formatting...
```

## Final Verdict

**Current Score: 8/10** — This is solid, authentic copy that will resonate with consultants.

**To get to 9/10:**
1. Add founder story for credibility
2. Include a visual demo of the product
3. Add FAQ to handle objections

**To get to 10/10:**
1. A/B test headline variations
2. Add video testimonials from real users
3. Include case studies with metrics ("Saved 5 hours/week")

The voice is right. The pain is real. The structure is clear. Just needs a bit of polish and some trust-building elements.
