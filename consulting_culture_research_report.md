# Consulting Culture Research Report
## For Website Copy Project — Understanding How Consultants Actually Talk

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This research dives deep into consulting culture, voice, pain points, and humor based on extensive analysis of Reddit r/consulting, Medium articles from former consultants, StrategyU content (by ex-McKinsey/BCG consultants), and industry publications. The goal is to understand how consultants ACTUALLY communicate — not how vendors think they do.

**Key Finding:** Consultants have a distinct, self-aware communication style that blends hyper-professionalism with dark humor about the absurdities of their work. They communicate in frameworks, obsess over process, and find catharsis in memes about slides, endless iterations, and client dysfunction.

---

## 1. THE CONSULTING "VOICE" — HOW THEY ACTUALLY COMMUNICATE

### Core Characteristics:

**1. Framework-Driven Thinking**
- Consultants think and speak in structured frameworks
- Examples: MECE, SCQA, Pyramid Principle, Issue Trees
- They "ladder" conversations up to strategic insights
- Everything gets put into a "so what?" framework

**2. Obsession with Process and Meta-Process**
- Not just "following a process" — but obsessing over HOW the process works
- Regular "problem-solving sessions" (not just meetings)
- Constantly asking: "Are we solving the REAL problem?"
- The "how we work" is as important as "what we deliver"

**3. Top-Down Communication Style**
- Start with the answer, then support with details
- "Start with the 'so what?'"
- Executive summary mentality
- "Book report thinking" is a common pitfall they mock

**4. Specific Phrases and Terminology**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Deck** | PowerPoint presentation |
| **Ghost deck** | Skeleton/outline of slides before content |
| **MECE** | Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive |
| **SCQA** | Situation, Complication, Question, Answer |
| **So what?** | The key insight/recommendation |
| **Up or out** | Promotion or termination culture |
| **On the beach** | Between projects/benched |
| **Staffed** | Assigned to a project |
| **Leverage** | Using junior staff to do work |
| **Delayering** | Layoffs (BCG's euphemism) |
| **Pyramid** | The hierarchical staffing model |
| **Single source of truth** | Centralized data (ironic joke about Excel chaos) |

### Direct Quotes (Reddit — usernames redacted):

> "Most of the people who say they can use PowerPoint actually can't."

> "I feel like I don't have any actual skills besides slides and writing emails."

> "The consultant's bread and butter is problem solving and presenting information in a compelling way."

> "When it comes to resource mgmt & allocation where I've been, seems like practically everything is Excel... Needless to say, version control is a mess and everyone has their own private single source of truth :)"

> "They hire mid-level managers to track all the moving parts against their spreadsheets."

## 2. SPECIFIC PAIN POINTS ABOUT SLIDES/POWERPOINT

### The Slide Culture

**1. Deck Obsession**
- Everything becomes a deck
- "Deck, deck, and more deck" (common Reddit post title)
- 80-slide presentations are normal
- Hours spent on formatting and alignment

**2. Iteration Hell**
- Multiple rounds of revisions
- "Version control is a mess"
- Everyone has their "private single source of truth"
- Ghost decks → full decks → final_final_v2 decks

**3. The PowerPoint Paradox**
- They know it's absurd but can't escape it
- "Planning to Plan" — the famous Office Space reference
- Making slides is both the job and the joke
- "Consulting is just..." memes often end with PowerPoint

**4. Formatting Over Substance Anxiety**
- Deep awareness that "good slides ≠ good thinking"
- Mocking over-designed decks
- Frustration with "book report thinking" — showing all the work instead of the answer

### Direct Quotes:

> "The ex-consultants on my team churn out incredible slides in no time. They can logically plan out projects. I feel really..."

> "When it comes to knowing who's on which project, the bench, utilization rates, profiles, even open positions etc, everyone just goes to Excel."

> "So much stuff falls through the cracks with all the ad hoc communication."

## 10. COPY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WEBSITE

### Tone to Strike:

**1. Insider Knowledge + Self-Awareness**
- Show you know the reality, not the glossy brochure
- Acknowledge the absurdity of slide culture
- Use real terminology naturally

**2. Framework-Loving but Framework-Mocking**
- Use MECE, SCQA, Pyramid Principle references
- But show awareness that frameworks can be overdone
- "We know you don't need another 2x2 matrix"

**3. Problem-First, Not Solution-First**
- Consultants hate when clients come with pre-baked solutions
- Start with the real problem
- "We don't build dashboards because you asked for one"

**4. Meta-Process Awareness**
- Show you care about HOW work gets done
- "Problem-solving sessions" not just meetings
- Process obsession is catnip to consultants

**5. AI-Aware but Not AI-Panicked**
- Acknowledge the disruption
- But position as opportunity, not just threat
- "From pyramid to obelisk — here's how to adapt"

### Specific Copy Angles That Would Land:

**Angle 1: The Slide Liberation**
> "Stop living in Final_Final_v2_ACTUAL.pptx hell. We know what it's like to spend 40 hours formatting slides that could have been an email."

**Angle 2: The So What? Promise**
> "We'll give you the 'so what?' first. Then the details. Because you don't have time for a book report."

**Angle 3: The Framework Rebellion**
> "Yes, we know MECE. We also know when to throw it out. The best consultants know the rules — and when to break them."

**Angle 4: The AI Adaptation**
> "The pyramid is becoming an obelisk. Here's how to be one of the people who stays."

**Angle 5: The Client Dysfunction Empathy**
> "You asked for a dashboard. But what you really need is...

## CONCLUSION

Consultants communicate with a unique blend of hyper-structured thinking, self-aware humor about their work's absurdities, and deep anxiety about AI disruption. They find catharsis in memes about slides, frameworks, and client dysfunction. To sound like an insider, you need to:

1. **Use their terminology naturally** (deck, MECE, staffed, so what?)
2. **Show meta-process awareness** (how we work matters)
3. **Acknowledge the AI threat** (pyramid → obelisk)
4. **Validate their pain points** (slide hell, client dysfunction)
5. **Be problem-first, not solution-first**
6. **Balance framework-love with framework-mockery**

The key is sounding like someone who's been in the trenches — not someone selling to the trenches.
