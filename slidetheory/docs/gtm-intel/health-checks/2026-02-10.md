## Summary

⚠️ **ALL GTM CRON JOBS FAILED TO PRODUCE OUTPUT**

- No daily brief generated
- No content queue created
- No outreach queue created (Tuesday = weekday, should exist)
- No analytics report generated

---

## Escalation Status

- **First occurrence:** Yes (infrastructure not yet initialized)
- **Consecutive failures:** N/A - Directory structure did not exist prior to this check
- **Action required:** Immediate setup of GTM cron jobs

---

## Notes

The entire `slidetheory/docs/gtm-intel/` directory structure was missing. This indicates the GTM automation system has not been initialized. This is either:

1. **Day 0** - System hasn't been deployed yet
2. **Infrastructure failure** - Previous data was lost
3. **Misconfiguration** - Jobs writing to wrong location

**Recommendation:** Review GTM deployment status and verify cron job configuration in OpenClaw gateway.
