## POST 1: Professional Announcement
**Theme:** "After 1 year in consulting, I noticed..."  
**Day:** Launch Day (Tuesday)  
**Time:** 9:00 AM ET  
**Format:** Article-style post with line breaks  
**Target Length:** ~1,200 characters

```
After 1 year in consulting, I noticed something that didn't make sense.

The smartest people I worked with were spending most of their time on tasks that required zero brainpower.

Formatting slides. Aligning text boxes. Hunting for the right shade of blue that matches the client's brand guidelines.

Not analyzing data. Not building strategy. Not solving problems.

Just... formatting.

I did the math. The average consultant spends 25-30 hours per week in PowerPoint. Of that, 60%+ is mechanical work — not thinking work.

That's why I built SlideTheory.

SlideTheory is an AI-powered framework generator for consultants. It handles the tedious parts of slide creation so you can focus on what actually matters: the analysis, the insights, the recommendations.

What it does:
→ Generates McKinsey-quality frameworks instantly
→ Formats data into presentation-ready visuals
→ Maintains consistent branding across entire decks
→ Lets you iterate in minutes, not hours

What it doesn't do:
→ Write your analysis for you
→ Replace your judgment
→ Remove the need for strategic thinking

I'm building this because I believe consultants should spend their time consulting, not wrestling with software.

The beta opens soon. If you're tired of the PowerPoint grind, I'd love to hear from you.

What percentage of your week do you spend on slide formatting? Curious if my 60% estimate is high or low.

## POST 2: Value-First Post
**Theme:** "3 slide templates every consultant needs"  
**Day:** Day 3 (Thursday)  
**Time:** 9:00 AM ET  
**Format:** Listicle with image carousel opportunity  
**Target Length:** ~1,000 characters

```
3 slide templates every consultant needs (and most reinvent every project):

1. THE ISSUE TREE
The classic problem breakdown. Start with the core question, branch into mutually exclusive components, end with testable hypotheses.

Use when: Kicking off a new workstream, getting alignment on scope.

2. THE 2×2 MATRIX
Plot any two variables against each other. Bonus points if one axis is "Ease" and the other is "Impact."

Use when: Prioritizing initiatives, segmenting customers, mapping competitive position.

3. THE WATERFALL BRIDGE
Show how you get from Point A to Point B with all the steps in between. The bread and butter of financial analysis.

Use when: Explaining variance, showing process flow, bridging metrics.

Here's the thing: Every consulting firm has these templates. They're in old decks, scattered across SharePoint, recreated from scratch each time.

What if they were just... available? One click. Properly formatted. Ready for your data.

That's the idea behind SlideTheory.

What's the one template you find yourself rebuilding over and over?

Drop it below — I might add it to the library.

## POST 3: Behind-the-Scenes
**Theme:** "How I'm building SlideTheory in public"  
**Day:** Day 5 (Saturday)  
**Time:** 10:00 AM ET  
**Format:** Personal narrative with image  
**Target Length:** ~1,200 characters

```
I'm building SlideTheory in public. Here's what that means:

Every week, I share:
→ What's working
→ What's broken
→ What I'm learning
→ What I'm struggling with

No polished case studies. No "everything is amazing" updates. Just the reality of building something from scratch while working full-time.

This week's honest update:

✅ What's working: The core framework generator is fast. Like, scary fast. A 20-slide outline in under 60 seconds.

❌ What's broken: The formatting engine is finicky. Getting PowerPoint to behave consistently is... not fun. Shocking, I know.

🤔 What I'm learning: Consultants don't want AI to do their thinking. They want AI to handle the tedious parts so they can focus on the thinking. Big distinction.

😅 What I'm struggling with: Balancing feature requests. Everyone wants something slightly different. Finding the common patterns is the real work.

Why build in public?

Because the feedback is immediate. Because the community keeps me accountable. Because it's more fun than building alone.

If you're building something too — whether it's a product, a practice, or a career — I highly recommend sharing the journey.

The support is real. The advice is valuable. And somehow, announcing your plans publicly makes you more likely to follow through.

What are you building right now? Drop it below. Let's support each other.
