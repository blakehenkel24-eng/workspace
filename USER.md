## Life Goals & Context

### Primary Goal
Build SlideTheory — AI-powered slide generation for strategy consultants. Target: **$1,000 MRR**.

### Current Projects
- **SlideTheory** — Core product. AI generates McKinsey/BCG/Bain-quality slides.
- Stack: Next.js, Supabase, Kimi API, Vercel, pgvector for RAG
- Status: MVP live, iterating on UX and generation quality

### Key Relationships
- Solo builder (for now). May add team as product grows.

### Preferences
- **Communication style:** Direct, high signal, no filler. Action-oriented.
- **Work style:** Morning productivity + late night bursts. Async preferred.
- **Pet peeves:** Asking for permission on safe, valuable work. Waiting when you could build.
- **Decision style:** "Ask forgiveness, not permission" for clearly-valuable work.
