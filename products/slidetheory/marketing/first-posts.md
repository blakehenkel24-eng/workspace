### Post 2: Value Thread — Data Migration Lessons
**Type:** Thread (12 tweets)  
**Timing:** Day 2, 9:00 AM ET

```
Tweet 1/12:
5 lessons from migrating a 10TB data warehouse in 48 hours (without downtime):

A thread on what actually works when everything's on fire 🧵

Tweet 2/12:
Lesson 1: Your rollback plan is more important than your migration plan.

Everyone obsesses over the "happy path." 

Smart teams spend 60% of their time planning for when things go wrong.

Tweet 3/12:
Lesson 2: Test with real data, not sample data.

Sample data lies. It doesn't have the weird edge cases, the null values in unexpected places, the encoding issues from 2017.

If you haven't tested with production-scale data, you haven't tested.

Tweet 4/12:
Lesson 3: Communication beats automation.

We had automated monitoring, automated alerts, automated rollback triggers.

But the thing that saved us? A 15-minute standup every 2 hours with all stakeholders.

Tweet 5/12:
Lesson 4: The "freeze" is a myth.

"We'll just freeze all writes for the weekend."

Reality: Business doesn't stop. Marketing has a campaign. Product needs metrics. Someone always needs "just one small thing."

Plan for movement, not stasis.

Tweet 6/12:
Lesson 5: Your confidence should be inversely proportional to your timeline.

The tighter the deadline, the more skeptical you should be.

"We'll definitely finish by Friday" = You'll definitely be working Saturday.

Tweet 7/12:
Bonus lesson: Document everything in real-time.

Not after. Not "when things calm down." 

Right now. While you're in it. Because you will forget the sequence of events, and that log will be gold when you're debugging at 3am.

Tweet 8/12:
The framework we used (and still use):

1. Pre-mortem: Everything that could go wrong
2. Rollback decision tree: Specific triggers for each scenario  
3. Communication protocol: Who gets called when
4. Validation checklist: How we know it worked

Tweet 9/12:
This isn't just about data migrations.

Any high-stakes technical project follows the same pattern:
- Plans fail
- Communication saves you
- Documentation is always worth it
- Confidence is often the enemy

Tweet 10/12:
The migration succeeded. Zero downtime. Zero data loss.

But the real win wasn't technical. It was the framework we built that we've used on every major project since.

Good process compounds.

Tweet 11/12:
I'm building SlideTheory to share these frameworks more broadly.

The patterns that work. The mistakes that teach. The systems that scale.

If this resonated, I'm writing more at slidetheory.com

Tweet 12/12:
What about you?

What's the hairiest technical migration you've survived? What did you learn?

Drop it below — I bet we can all learn from each other.

(And yes, I'll be sharing more frameworks like this)

### Post 1: Launch Announcement
**Type:** Article/Newsletter-style post  
**Timing:** Launch Day, 9:00 AM ET

```
I'm excited to share that I'm launching SlideTheory — a new approach to technology strategy and consulting.

After [X years] in the trenches building data platforms, advising startups, and leading technical teams, I've developed a methodology that helps leaders cut through complexity and make better decisions.

Here's what we're building:

→ Frameworks for technology strategy that actually work in the real world
→ Data system design that scales with your business, not against it
→ Decision-making tools for technical leaders facing ambiguous challenges

Why now?

Because I've watched too many companies struggle with the same problems:
- Data systems that cost millions but deliver confusion
- Technical strategy that looks good in decks but fails in practice
- Decisions made on gut feelings instead of structured thinking

SlideTheory is my answer to these challenges. It's the culmination of frameworks I've developed, tested, and refined across dozens of engagements.

What to expect:

I'll be sharing what I learn, what works, and what doesn't. Real case studies. Practical frameworks. The occasional hard lesson.

If you're a technology leader, a founder navigating technical decisions, or a consultant looking for better tools — I'd love to connect.

📩 Open to advisory conversations: hello@slidetheory.com

### Post 2: The Tools Before Decisions Problem
**Type:** Short-form insight post  
**Timing:** Day 3, 9:00 AM ET

```
The #1 mistake I see in data strategy:

Starting with the tools instead of the decisions.

Most companies buy Snowflake/dbt/Looker before they know what questions they're trying to answer.

Then they wonder why adoption is low and ROI is unclear.

Flip the order:

1. Decisions — What choices do you need to make?
2. Data — What information would improve those decisions?
3. Tools — What's the simplest way to deliver that data?

This sounds obvious. But I've seen $10M+ data programs built backwards.

The tool vendors have done an excellent job convincing us that technology is the hard part.

It's not. The hard part is clarity.

What's a decision you wish you had better data for?

### Post 3: Origin Story
**Type:** Personal narrative  
**Timing:** Week 2, Wednesday, 9:00 AM ET

```
Three years ago, I watched a company burn $4M on a data transformation that delivered exactly nothing.

Not because they hired the wrong vendor.
Not because they lacked technical talent.
Not because they didn't "get" data.

Because they skipped the step no one talks about: defining the problem.

They knew they wanted "better data." They didn't know what decisions that data would improve. So they built a beautiful, expensive system that answered questions no one was asking.

I was brought in to "fix the adoption problem."

But adoption wasn't the problem. The system was solving the wrong problems.

That engagement changed how I approach every project.

Now, I start every engagement the same way:

"Forget the technology for a moment. What decisions are you struggling to make?"

We map the decisions first. Then the data. Then the tools.

Sometimes the answer is a $2M data platform. Sometimes it's a $200/month BI tool. Sometimes it's just better-defined meetings.

The point is: you can't know until you start with the decision.

This is the core of SlideTheory. Frameworks that start with clarity, not technology.

I'm writing more about this approach at slidetheory.com. If you're navigating data strategy decisions, I'd love to hear what you're wrestling with.

What's a decision you wish was easier to make?

### Post 4: Resource Share
**Type:** Link share with commentary  
**Timing:** Week 2, Thursday, 10:00 AM ET

```
I wrote about a pattern I've seen destroy data initiatives at 10+ companies.

It's called "The Dashboard Trap" — building visibility without action.

Every company wants dashboards. Few ask: "What will someone DO differently after seeing this?"

If the answer is "be more informed," you're building a very expensive decoration.

The article walks through:
→ Why dashboards often fail to drive action
→ The questions to ask before building any visualization
→ A framework for connecting data to decisions

I wrote this because I've had to deliver the hard news too many times: "Your $500K dashboard project should probably be a $5K spreadsheet."

The technology isn't the value. The clarity is.

Link in comments (LinkedIn doesn't love external links in posts, but this is worth it).

What's your experience with dashboard projects? Hit or miss?

### Post 5: Community Engagement
**Type:** Question post  
**Timing:** Week 2, Friday, 2:00 PM ET

```
Consultants: What's the one framework you use in every engagement?

Mine is the Pre-Mortem.

Before any major initiative, I gather the team and ask: "It's 6 months from now and this failed spectacularly. What happened?"

The insights are always gold. The risks people actually worry about (but won't say in a "planning" meeting) come out. You get the real concerns, not the sanitized versions.

I then structure the engagement around mitigating those specific risks.

It's simple. It works every time. And clients are always surprised by how revealing the exercise is.

But I'm curious — what framework do you find yourself returning to again and again?

Drop yours below. I bet we can all expand our toolkits.

### Comment 1: r/consulting — Career Advice
**Type:** Comment response  
**Timing:** Week 1, when relevant post appears

```
I made the switch from [engineering/operations] to consulting about [X years ago], and the biggest surprise was how little it had to do with technical expertise.

Don't get me wrong — you need to know your domain. But the value isn't in knowing more than the client. It's in:

1. **Asking better questions.** Most clients know what they need, but they can't articulate it. Your job is to draw it out.

2. **Pattern recognition.** You've seen this problem (or something like it) before. You know what works and what doesn't. That pattern library is your real value.

3. **Structured communication.** The ability to take complexity and make it clear. Most technical people can solve problems. Few can explain the solution in a way that drives action.

My advice: Start consulting on the side if you can. Small projects. You'll learn quickly whether you enjoy the work.

Also, read "The McKinsey Way" and "Flawless Consulting." They're classics for a reason.

Happy to answer more specific questions if helpful.

### Comment 2: r/ExperiencedDevs — Technical Architecture
**Type:** Comment response  
**Timing:** Week 1-2, when relevant post appears

```
I've seen this exact scenario play out at three different companies. Here's what actually happens:

**The "temporary" solution becomes permanent.** That prototype built "just to get us through Q2" is still running two years later. Now it's business-critical and no one wants to touch it.

**The migration gets postponed indefinitely.** Every quarter, there's a higher priority. "We'll do it after the fundraise." "After the product launch." "After the holiday freeze." It never happens.

**The team burns out.** Your best engineers know the system is fragile. They're afraid to deploy. They're working weekends to fix issues. Eventually they leave.

**What worked for us:**

We stopped trying to "find time" for the migration and made it the priority. We told stakeholders: "We're not building new features for 6 weeks. Here's why, and here's what happens if we don't."

It was uncomfortable. But it happened.

My framework now: Calculate the cost of NOT migrating (incident risk, velocity loss, retention risk). Present that as the cost of delay. Usually gets the priority you need.

What's your current incident rate? That might be your best argument.

### Original Post: r/consulting — Framework Sharing
**Type:** Original post  
**Timing:** Week 2-3, after building some karma

```
Title: I built a framework for technology strategy after seeing the same failure pattern 3 times

Body:

I've been consulting on data and technology strategy for [X years], and I kept seeing the same scenario:

Company raises Series B. Decides they need to "get serious about data." Hires expensive firm. Builds impressive-looking system. 18 months later, no one's using it and they're wondering where the ROI is.

After seeing this play out multiple times, I developed a framework I now use on every engagement. Sharing it here in case it's useful to others.

**The Decision-First Framework:**

The core insight: Data systems should serve decisions, not the other way around.

**Step 1: Decision Audit**
Before touching any technology, I sit with leadership and ask: "What decisions are you making poorly (or slowly) because you lack information?"

Not "what data do you want to see?" That's the trap. Decisions first.

**Step 2: Information Mapping**
For each decision, what information would improve it? Sometimes it's a metric. Sometimes it's a report. Sometimes it's just a clearer meeting structure.

**Step 3: Technology Fit**
Now (and only now) do we talk tools. What's the simplest technology that delivers the required information?

Sometimes that's a $100K data platform. Sometimes it's a $500/month BI tool. Sometimes it's just better-defined Slack channels.

**The results:**

- Faster time-to-value (weeks instead of quarters)
- Higher adoption (because it's built around actual needs)
- Clearer ROI (tied to decision quality, not vanity metrics)

**Why this works:**

Most data projects start with "we need a data warehouse" or "we need dashboards." They're technology-first.

But technology is easy. Clarity is hard. The Decision-First Framework forces clarity before technology.

**Caveats:**

This doesn't work if leadership won't engage on the decision audit. I've had to walk away from engagements where the C-suite just wanted to "check the data box" without doing the thinking work.

Also, this is harder to sell. "Let me audit your decisions" is less sexy than "I'll build you a modern data stack." But it's more valuable.

**Would love your thoughts:**

Have you seen similar patterns? What frameworks do you use to avoid the "build it and they will come" trap?

Happy to go deeper on any part of this. Also happy to be told I'm wrong if you've seen this approach fail.

### Comment 4: r/dataengineering — Tool Selection
**Type:** Comment response  
**Timing:** Ongoing, when relevant

```
I've been through this evaluation at three companies. A few observations:

**The "best" tool is the one your team will actually use.** Sounds obvious, but I've seen companies choose the technically superior option that required a skillset they didn't have. Six months later, they're hiring consultants to maintain it.

**Consider your data volume growth.** If you're at 1TB now and growing 2x per year, plan for 8TB in two years. Some tools that work great at small scale become expensive nightmares at scale.

**The ecosystem matters more than the tool.** dbt is popular not because it's perfect, but because there's a huge community. When you hit a weird edge case (and you will), that community saves you days of debugging.

**My bias:** I lean toward tools with clear upgrade paths. Start simple, add complexity only when needed. It's easier to add features than to rip out over-engineering.

What's your team's current skillset? That matters more than any feature comparison matrix.
```

### Comment 5: r/startups — Founder Advice
**Type:** Comment response  
**Timing:** Ongoing, when relevant

```
Founder here (well, former founder turned consultant). A few hard truths:

**Don't build what you can buy.** I know, I know — "but our use case is special." It's probably not. And even if it is, the 6 months you spend building will cost you more than the SaaS subscription would have.

**Your first data hire shouldn't be an engineer.** Hire an analyst who understands the business. They'll tell you what you actually need to measure. Then hire engineers to build the plumbing.

**Dashboards are not strategy.** Every founder wants visibility. Few ask: "What decision will this visibility change?" If you can't answer that, you're building a very expensive decoration.

**Data debt is real.** The messy spreadsheet structure you set up in the early days will haunt you when you try to scale. Invest in clean data practices before you "need" them.

**The metric that matters most is the one you're not tracking.** Whatever you're obsessing over (MAU, revenue, churn) — there's probably a leading indicator you're ignoring. Find it.

Happy to go deeper on any of these. Also open to being wrong if you've had different experiences.

### Video 1: The Framework I Use for Every Technology Decision
**Type:** Educational/Process  
**Length:** 8-12 minutes  
**Timing:** Week 2-3

```
[HOOK - 0:00-0:30]

"I've watched companies burn millions on technology decisions that were doomed from the start.

Not because they picked the wrong tool. Because they never defined what 'right' looked like.

In this video, I'm going to share the framework I use on every technology decision — whether it's a $500K platform purchase or a $50/month SaaS tool.

It's simple. It takes 30 minutes. And it will save you from expensive mistakes."

[INTRO - 0:30-1:00]

"I'm Blake Henkel, and I help technology leaders make better decisions. After [X years] building data platforms and advising companies, I developed this framework because I kept seeing the same pattern: smart people making expensive mistakes because they skipped the clarity step.

The framework is called 'The Decision Triangle' — Speed, Quality, Cost. Pick two. Every time."

[THE PROBLEM - 1:00-3:00]

[Explain the common failure pattern with specific example]

"Let me tell you about a company I worked with. They wanted to 'improve their data infrastructure.' So they evaluated three tools, picked the one with the best features, and spent 6 months implementing it.

18 months later, adoption was at 15% and they were wondering why.

The problem? They never defined what success looked like. They focused on the tool, not the outcome."

[THE FRAMEWORK - 3:00-7:00]

[Walk through the Decision Triangle framework with visuals]

"Here's how it works. For any technology decision, you have three levers:

1. Speed — How fast can you implement?
2. Quality — How robust/feature-complete is the solution?
3. Cost — What's your budget (money + time)?

You can optimize for two. The third will suffer. Every time.

Most companies try to optimize for all three. They want it fast, perfect, and cheap. That's not a strategy. That's a fantasy.

The magic happens when you consciously choose which two matter most for THIS decision."

[CASE STUDY - 7:00-10:00]

[Apply framework to real example]

"Let's apply this to a real scenario. Say you're choosing a data warehouse...

If you're pre-product-market fit, optimize for Speed + Cost. You need something NOW and you don't have budget. Quality can wait.

If you're scaling post-Series B, optimize for Quality + Speed. You have budget, and downtime is expensive.

If you're optimizing margins at Series C, maybe Quality + Cost matters more than Speed.

The point is: there's no universal 'best' choice. There's only 'best for your situation.'"

[ACTION STEPS - 10:00-11:00]

"Here's what I want you to do:

1. Take one technology decision you're facing right now
2. Write down your constraints for Speed, Quality, and Cost
3. Consciously choose which TWO you're optimizing for
4. Evaluate options only against those two criteria

You'll be shocked how much clearer the decision becomes."

[OUTRO - 11:00-12:00]

"That's the Decision Triangle. Simple, but not easy. The hard part is being honest about trade-offs.

### Video 2: Why Most Data Strategies Fail (And How to Fix Yours)
**Type:** Problem/Solution  
**Length:** 10-15 minutes  
**Timing:** Week 3-4

```
[HOOK]

"70% of data initiatives fail to deliver business value. Not because of bad technology. Because of a fundamental misunderstanding about what data strategy actually is.

In this video, I'm going to tell you why most data strategies fail — and exactly how to build one that works."

[THE FAILURE PATTERN]

[Describe the common failure pattern with specific metrics/examples]

"Here's what I see over and over:

1. Company decides they need to 'get serious about data'
2. They hire expensive consultants or build a data team
3. They build impressive infrastructure — warehouses, pipelines, dashboards
4. 18 months later, no one's using it and ROI is unclear

The technology worked perfectly. The strategy failed completely."

[THE ROOT CAUSE]

"The root cause is starting with data instead of decisions.

Most data strategies start with: 'What data do we have?' or 'What tools should we buy?'

They should start with: 'What decisions are we struggling to make?'

Data is not the product. Better decisions are the product. Data is just the input."

[THE SOLUTION FRAMEWORK]

[Present the Decision-First Framework]

"Here's the framework that actually works:

Step 1: Decision Audit
Map the 5-10 most important decisions your leadership team makes. Where do they feel like they're flying blind?

Step 2: Information Requirements
For each decision, what information would improve it? Be specific. Not 'better visibility' — 'knowing customer churn by cohort within 24 hours of month-end.'

Step 3: Data Mapping
Now (and only now) do we ask: what data do we need to produce that information?

Step 4: Technology Selection
What's the simplest tool that delivers the required data?

Step 5: Implementation Roadmap
Sequence based on decision impact, not technical convenience."

[REAL EXAMPLE]

[Walk through a real case study]

"I worked with a SaaS company that had spent $2M on a data platform with 12% adoption.

We did the Decision Audit. Turns out, the CEO made one decision every Monday morning: which customer segments to prioritize for retention outreach.

But the dashboard they built showed aggregate metrics. Not segment-level data. Not timely enough for Monday morning decisions.

So we built one report. One. It took 3 weeks. It answered that specific decision.

Adoption went from 12% to 100% (the CEO used it every week). Total cost: $30K.

The $2M platform wasn't wrong. It was just solving the wrong problems."

[IMPLEMENTATION STEPS]

"If you're leading data strategy, here's your homework:

1. Schedule 30 minutes with your CEO/leadership team
2. Ask: 'What decisions do you make where you wish you had better information?'
3. Pick the highest-impact decision
4. Build the minimum viable data product for that ONE decision
5. Prove value. Then expand.

Don't build the platform. Build the decision support."

[OUTRO]

"Data strategy isn't about technology. It's about clarity.

### Video 3: 5 Lessons from Migrating a Data Warehouse (Real Case Study)
**Type:** Case Study  
**Length:** 12-18 minutes  
**Timing:** Week 3-4

```
[HOOK]

"We had 48 hours to migrate 10 terabytes of data with zero downtime. If we failed, the company lost $100K per hour.

This is the story of how we did it — and the 5 lessons I'll never forget."

[SETUP]

[Context about the migration]

"This was [Year], at [Type of Company]. We were migrating from [Old System] to [New System]. 

The stakes: [X] users, [Y] daily transactions, $[Z] revenue at risk.

We had one weekend. 48 hours. And if anything went wrong, we had to be able to roll back in under 30 minutes."

[LESSON 1: The Rollback Plan]

"Lesson 1: Your rollback plan is more important than your migration plan.

We spent 60% of our prep time planning for failure. Not because we expected to fail. But because if we needed to rollback, we'd be under maximum stress with no time to think.

We had a decision tree: IF [scenario] THEN [action] WITHIN [timeframe].

No judgment calls in the moment. Just execute the plan."

[LESSON 2: Testing with Real Data]

"Lesson 2: Test with production data, not sample data.

Sample data lies. It doesn't have the weird edge cases from 2017, the encoding issues, the null values in unexpected places.

Our first test with sample data: 'perfect, 2 hours.'

First test with production data: 'failed at hour 6, data corruption in legacy records.'

That failure saved us. We found it in testing, not production."

[LESSON 3: Communication Protocol]

"Lesson 3: Communication beats automation.

We had automated monitoring. Automated alerts. Automated rollback triggers.

But the thing that actually kept us sane? A 15-minute standup every 2 hours.

Everyone in one room (well, one Zoom). What's working. What's not. What we're worried about.

When things get stressful, humans need humans. Not dashboards."

[LESSON 4: The Freeze Myth]

"Lesson 4: The 'freeze' is a myth.

'We'll just freeze all writes for the weekend.'

Reality: Business doesn't stop. Marketing has a campaign. Product needs metrics. Someone always needs 'just one small thing.'

We planned for movement, not stasis. Built a queue system for writes that came in during migration. Accepted that some data would be 6 hours stale.

That acceptance saved us from scope creep panic."

[LESSON 5: Real-Time Documentation]

"Lesson 5: Document in real-time.

Not after. Not 'when things calm down.' Right now. While you're in it.

Because at 3am, when you're debugging why something failed, you will not remember what happened at 9pm. But your log will.

We rotated a 'scribe' role. Every hour, they documented: what we did, what we saw, what we decided.

That document became our post-mortem, our incident report, and our training material for the next migration."

[THE OUTCOME]

"The migration succeeded. Zero downtime. Zero data loss. We even finished 6 hours early.

But the real win wasn't technical. It was the framework we built — the decision trees, the communication protocols, the documentation habits.

We've used that framework on every major project since.

Good process compounds."

[TAKEAWAYS]

"If you're facing a high-stakes technical project:

1. Plan for failure, not just success
2. Test with real conditions
3. Over-communicate
4. Expect change
5. Document everything

These aren't just migration lessons. They're project lessons. Decision lessons. Life lessons."

[OUTRO]

"I share more case studies and frameworks at slidetheory.com. Subscribe here for weekly videos.

What's the hairiest technical project you've survived? Drop it in the comments — I read every one.

Thanks for watching."

### Video 4: The Consulting Skill Nobody Teaches You
**Type:** Insight/Opinion  
**Length:** 6-10 minutes  
**Timing:** Week 4-5

```
[HOOK]

"There's one skill that separates good consultants from great ones. And it's not technical expertise. It's not communication. It's not even problem-solving.

It's something no one teaches you in business school or certification programs.

In this video, I'm going to tell you what it is — and how to develop it."

[THE SKILL: MANAGED UNCERTAINTY]

"The skill is: being comfortable with managed uncertainty.

Most people want clarity before action. They want to know the answer before they start.

But consulting — especially technology consulting — doesn't work that way. You're dealing with complex systems, incomplete information, and changing conditions.

The best consultants I've worked with share this trait: they can act decisively with 70% confidence. They know when 'good enough' information is good enough."

[THE PROBLEM: PARALYSIS BY ANALYSIS]

"Here's the failure pattern I see:

Consultant gets brought in to solve a problem. They start researching. And researching. And researching.

They want to be SURE before they make a recommendation. So they delay. They ask for more data. More time.

Meanwhile, the client is bleeding money. The window for action is closing.

By the time the consultant is 'ready,' the situation has changed and the analysis is obsolete.

Perfect analysis of the wrong moment."

[THE FRAMEWORK: CONFIDENCE THRESHOLDS]

"Here's the framework I use: Confidence Thresholds.

For different types of decisions, I define the minimum confidence I need:

- Irreversible decisions (architecture choices, major purchases): 90% confidence
- High-stakes reversible decisions (team structure, process changes): 70% confidence  
- Low-stakes decisions (tools, minor workflows): 51% confidence (just better than a coin flip)

The key is deciding the threshold BEFORE you start analyzing. So you know when to stop."

[EXAMPLES]

[Give concrete examples of each threshold in action]

"I was working with a company choosing between two cloud providers. High stakes, hard to reverse.

We spent 3 weeks analyzing. Multiple POCs. Cost modeling. Risk assessment.

90% confidence threshold met. Decision made.

Contrast that with choosing a project management tool for a 5-person team. Low stakes, easy to change.

We did a 2-hour comparison and picked one. 60% confidence. Done.

The time we didn't spend over-analyzing the tool choice went into the cloud provider analysis.

Resource allocation based on decision stakes."

[HOW TO DEVELOP THIS SKILL]

"So how do you get better at this?

1. **Practice time-boxing.** Give yourself a deadline for the recommendation. When time's up, decide with what you have.

2. **Define 'good enough' upfront.** What would convince you? Write it down. When you hit it, stop.

3. **Track your decisions.** Keep a log. What did you decide? What was your confidence? What happened? Over time, you'll calibrate.

4. **Accept that you'll be wrong sometimes.** That's the price of speed. The key is being wrong on reversible decisions, not irreversible ones."

[OUTRO]

"Managed uncertainty. It's the skill that lets you move fast without being reckless.

If this resonated, subscribe. And let me know in the comments: How do you know when you have 'enough' information to decide?

I read every comment. Thanks for watching."

### Video 5: How I Structure Technology Strategy Engagements
**Type:** Process/Methodology  
**Length:** 10-14 minutes  
**Timing:** Week 4-6

```
[HOOK]

"I've run over [X] technology strategy engagements. And I've developed a specific structure that works every time.

It's not complicated. But it is deliberate.

In this video, I'm going to walk you through exactly how I structure a technology strategy engagement — from first conversation to final deliverable."

[PHASE 1: DISCOVERY — WEEKS 1-2]

"Phase 1 is Discovery. But not the kind most people do.

Most discovery is about understanding the current state. 'Show me your systems. Tell me your pain points.'

My discovery is about understanding decisions. 'What are you trying to achieve? What choices are you struggling with?'

I spend the first two weeks in deep conversation with leadership. Not about technology. About business outcomes.

The goal: clarity on what success looks like. Not in technical terms. In business terms.

'Reduce customer churn by 15%' is better than 'implement better analytics.'"

[PHASE 2: ASSESSMENT — WEEKS 3-4]

"Phase 2 is Assessment.

Now I look at the current state. But through the lens of the decisions we identified in Phase 1.

I'm not auditing everything. I'm auditing the systems and processes that affect those specific decisions.

The output isn't a 50-page assessment document. It's a 5-page focused evaluation: what's working, what's broken, what matters for the decisions at hand."

[PHASE 3: OPTIONS — WEEKS 5-6]

"Phase 3 is Options.

I never present one recommendation. I present 3:

1. **The Minimum** — What gets you 80% of the value for 20% of the effort?
2. **The Target** — What gets you 95% of the value for reasonable effort?
3. **The Maximum** — What gets you 100% of the value, regardless of effort?

Each option includes: cost, timeline, risks, and the specific decisions it improves.

This respects the client's autonomy. They're the decision-maker. I'm the option-generator."

[PHASE 4: DECISION — WEEK 7]

"Phase 4 is Decision.

We walk through the options. I facilitate the discussion, but they choose.

My role here is to make sure they're choosing based on the right criteria. Not 'what sounds impressive' or 'what the board will like.'

But 'what actually moves us toward the outcomes we defined in Phase 1?'

Once the decision is made, we lock it in. No second-guessing. Full commitment."

[PHASE 5: ROADMAP — WEEKS 8-10]

"Phase 5 is Roadmap.

Now we turn the decision into an execution plan.

Not just 'what do we build?' but 'who does what by when?'

I include: milestones, dependencies, risk mitigations, and success metrics.

The goal: the client can execute without me. I'm building their capability, not creating dependency."

[PHASE 6: TRANSITION — WEEKS 11-12]

"Phase 6 is Transition.

I don't just drop a report and leave. I transition knowledge.

Workshops. Documentation. Office hours. Whatever it takes for the team to own the strategy.

My measure of success: 6 months later, they're executing successfully and I'm not involved.

That's a successful engagement."

[THE PRINCIPLES]

"Underlying this structure are three principles:

1. **Decisions over deliverables.** The goal is better decisions, not impressive documents.

2. **Client capability over consultant dependency.** They should be stronger after, not more dependent.

3. **Business outcomes over technical perfection.** What matters is what works in their context, not what's theoretically optimal."

[OUTRO]

"That's the structure. 12 weeks. 6 phases. Clear outcomes at each step.

If you're a consultant, try it. If you're hiring a consultant, ask for this clarity.

And if you want to go deeper, I've got templates and frameworks at slidetheory.com.

### Video 1: 3 Signs Your Data Strategy Is Broken
**Type:** Educational/List  
**Length:** 30-45 seconds  
**Timing:** Week 1

```
[HOOK - 0-3 seconds]
"3 signs your data strategy is broken..."

[CONTENT - 3-40 seconds]
"Number 1: Your dashboards have more viewers than your product.

If 50 people log into your analytics but only 10 use your actual product, you're measuring the wrong things.

Number 2: Your data team spends more time explaining numbers than finding insights.

If every request turns into a 3-email thread about definitions, your data model is broken.

Number 3: You have 'data-driven' in your company values but decisions are still made in Slack DMs.

Culture beats tools. Every time."

### Video 2: The Consulting Trick That Saves Every Project
**Type:** Story/Insight  
**Length:** 45-60 seconds  
**Timing:** Week 2

```
[HOOK - 0-3 seconds]
"The consulting trick that saves every project..."

[CONTENT - 3-50 seconds]
"I learned this from a partner at McKinsey. He called it 'The Pre-Mortem.'

Before any big project, gather the team and say: 'It's six months from now and this failed spectacularly. What happened?'

At first, people are uncomfortable. But then the real concerns come out.

'We didn't get buy-in from Sales.'
'The data quality was worse than we thought.'
'The CEO changed priorities mid-project.'

The risks people actually worry about — but won't say in a 'planning' meeting.

Write them all down. Then build your plan around avoiding those specific failures.

I've used this on 50+ projects. It catches blind spots every single time."

```
[HOOK - 0-3 seconds]
"Stop doing this with your data warehouse..."

[CONTENT - 3-50 seconds]
"Building for 'future scale' on day one.

I get it. You don't want to rebuild in 6 months. So you over-engineer.

You add every field you MIGHT need. You build for 10x volume you don't have. You implement features for use cases that don't exist yet.

Here's what actually happens:

You ship slower because everything's more complex. You have more bugs because there's more surface area. And in 6 months, your 'future-proof' design is obsolete anyway because requirements changed.

Build for today's reality. Refactor when you hit constraints. Not before.

Complexity is the enemy of progress."

[CTA - 50-60 seconds]
"Agree or disagree? Fight me in the comments. Follow for more unpopular opinions."
