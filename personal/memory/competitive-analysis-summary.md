## Pricing Analysis

### Current SlideTheory Pricing (from ToS)
- **Free:** 10 slides/month
- **Pro:** $12/month (100 slides, high-res, all templates)
- **Team:** $39/month (unlimited, custom branding, team library)

### Market Position
- **Entry price** is competitive vs Beautiful.ai ($12) and Canva ($12.99)
- **Team pricing at $39/month** is NOT competitive - Beautiful.ai is $40/user (but per-user, not flat)
- **Major opportunity:** Team pricing is confusing - is it $39 flat or per-user?

### Recommendations
1. **Clarify team pricing** - Per-user vs flat pricing unclear
2. **Consider $8-10 entry** to undercut Beautiful.ai/Canva
3. **Team sweet spot:** $15-20/user would be 50% cheaper than Beautiful.ai
4. **Add annual discount:** 16-20% is market standard

---

3. **Quality** - Professional results out of the box
4. **Value** - Premium features without enterprise pricing

- Missing enterprise features
- No mobile apps

- **New Well-Funded Startup** - Medium probability

## Top 5 Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Fix Team Pricing (URGENT)
The $39/month team pricing is unclear and potentially uncompetitive. Clarify if this is per-user or flat rate.

### 2. Add Critical Integrations (HIGH)
- **Notion** - High user overlap, relatively easy to implement
- **Slack** - Team sharing, notifications
- **Figma** - Designer audience

### 3. Build Embedding Capability (MEDIUM)
Gamma's web embedding is a key differentiator. SlideTheory should offer:
- Public share links
- Embeddable player
- Password protection

### 4. Close Collaboration Gap (HIGH)
Real-time co-editing is table stakes for team plans. Current "🟡 Partial" status needs to become "✅ Full".

### 5. Launch Template Marketplace (MEDIUM)
Canva's 1000+ templates create network effects. Start with:
- Community submissions
- Revenue share model
- Vertical-specific packs

## Is the Pricing Right?

### Verdict: **MOSTLY, with caveats**

| Tier | Assessment |
|------|------------|
| **Free** | ✅ Generous enough for trials |
| **Pro $12** | ✅ Competitive with Beautiful.ai/Canva |
| **Team $39** | ⚠️ **UNCLEAR** - Per-user or flat? If flat, good. If per-user, too expensive. |

### Suggested Pricing Refresh
```
Free:       $0     - 10 slides/month, basic templates
Pro:        $10    - 100 slides/month, all templates, high-res
Team:       $18/user/mo - Unlimited, collaboration, admin
Enterprise: Custom - SSO, audit logs, dedicated support
```
