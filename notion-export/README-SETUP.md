# 📋 Notion Workspace Import Guide

Welcome to your Life OS, Blake! This folder contains everything you need to import your complete personal and professional workspace into Notion.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Your Notion Workspace
1. Go to [notion.so](https://notion.so) and log in
2. Create a new page called **"Blake's Life OS"**
3. Set an icon (⚡ recommended for SAKI energy)

### Step 2: Import the Structure

#### Option A: Manual Copy-Paste (Recommended)
Best for preserving formatting, toggles, and checkboxes.

1. Open each `.md` file in this folder
2. Copy the entire contents
3. Paste into a new Notion page
4. Notion will auto-convert:
   - `# Headers` → Page headings
   - `- [ ]` → Checkboxes
   - `> ` → Callout blocks
   - `| Tables |` → Database tables
   - Toggle lists → Notion toggles

#### Option B: Bulk Import
For faster setup (some formatting may need adjustment):

1. Go to Settings & Members → Import → Markdown & CSV
2. Select all files in this folder
3. Let Notion process the import
4. Reorganize pages as needed

### Step 3: Set Up Your Sidebar

Drag pages into this order for optimal workflow:

## 🎯 Success Tips

### From SAKI ⚡

1. **Start Simple** — Don't customize everything on day one. Use it for a week, then adjust.

2. **The 2-Minute Rule** — If a task takes <2 min, do it now. Don't let small things pile up.

3. **Weekly Reviews Are Sacred** — This is where progress happens. Don't skip them.

4. **Connect to Goals** — Every project should link to a 2026 goal. If it doesn't, question why you're doing it.

5. **Ship Fast, Iterate** — Your Life OS is a living document. Update it as you evolve.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Formatting Looks Weird?**
- Notion's import can be finicky with complex tables
- Copy-paste manually for best results
- Use `/` commands to reformat quickly

**Databases Not Importing Correctly?**
- CSV import works best when columns are simple
- Re-create manually if needed (takes 5 min)
- Set column types immediately after import

**Want to Start Fresh?**
- Delete the page and re-import
- Keep this folder as your backup
- All data is yours forever
