## THE 5-SECOND TEST
A slide passes if you can understand the main point in 5 seconds by only reading the title.

**Formula:** [Subject] + [Action] + [Driver/Result] + [Number]
- ✅ "Acquisition accelerates growth by 18 months, capturing $45M revenue"
- ❌ "Market Analysis" or "Growth Opportunities"

---

## QUALITY RUBRIC (1-10)

| Dimension | Weight | 10/10 Standard |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **Title** | 25% | Action-oriented, specific insight, has "so what" |
| **Structure** | 25% | Perfect MECE (no overlap, no gaps) |
| **Content** | 20% | Every bullet: Insight + Data + So What |
| **Visual** | 15% | Clear hierarchy, eye flows to insight first |
| **Data** | 10% | Perfect formatting, every number contextualized |
| **Language** | 5% | Active voice, no weak words |

**Target:** 9+/10 for all production slides

---

## MECE FRAMEWORKS (Use These)

| Situation | Framework |
|-----------|-----------|
| Financial | Revenue, Cost, Capital |
| Market | Geography, Segment, Channel |
| Time | Short-term, Medium-term, Long-term |
| Options | Option A, Option B, Option C |
| Organization | People, Process, Technology |

**MECE Test:**
1. Can any item fit in two categories? → If YES, not MECE
2. Is there anything that doesn't fit? → If YES, gap exists
3. Do parts sum to the whole? → If NO, structure broken

---

## THE PERFECT BULLET

**Format:** [Insight] → [Data] → [So What]

**Example:**
- ❌ "Customer satisfaction is 8.2"
- ✅ "Customer satisfaction improved to 8.2 (+0.4), reducing churn risk for 15% of at-risk accounts worth $2.1M ARR"

**Checklist for every bullet:**
- [ ] Answers "So what?"
- [ ] Has specific data
- [ ] Explains what it means
- [ ] Would client learn something new?

---

## PROHIBITED WORDS (Instant Score Penalty)

**Weak Qualifiers:** very, really, quite, pretty, fairly
**Uncertainty:** maybe, perhaps, possibly, might (unless genuine)
**Filler:** obviously, clearly, basically, essentially
**Vague:** good, bad, nice, interesting

**Use Instead:** Accelerate, capture, drive, enable, execute, expand, leverage, optimize, prioritize, scale, streamline, unlock

---

## LAYOUT SELECTION

| Message Type | Layout |
|--------------|--------|
| Single key insight | Executive Summary |
| Problem breakdown | Issue Tree |
| Two-dimension comparison | 2×2 Matrix |
| Progression/variance | Waterfall |
| Multi-option comparison | Comparison Table |
| Step-by-step | Process Flow |

---

## DATA FORMATTING

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Large numbers | K/M/B | "$45M" not "$45,000,000" |
| Percentages | Show base | "65% of enterprise customers" |
| Growth | Show period | "+15% vs Q3 2023" |
| Sources | Always cite | "Source: Company financials" |

---

## COMMON FAILURE MODES

| Failure | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Descriptive Title | "Market Analysis" | Add action + insight + number |
| Non-MECE | Overlapping categories | Use established framework |
| No Insight | Just facts | Add "which means..." |
| Missing So What | Data dumps | Explain implication |
| Weak Language | "Very good" | Strong action verbs |
| Kitchen Sink | 6+ points | One slide = one point |

---

## PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST

**Before marking complete, verify:**

Title:
- [ ] Complete sentence (subject + verb)
- [ ] Specific numbers
- [ ] Answers "so what?"

Structure:
- [ ] Categories are MECE
- [ ] Each point supports title

Content:
- [ ] Every bullet: insight + data + so what
- [ ] Sources cited

Visual:
- [ ] Clear hierarchy
- [ ] Chart matches message

Language:
- [ ] No prohibited words
- [ ] Active voice

---

## EXAMPLES: GOOD VS BAD

**Title Examples:**
```
10/10: "Q3 EBITDA exceeds target by 12% driven by cost optimization"
8/10:  "Q3 showed strong performance in multiple areas"
4/10:  "Q3 Financial Performance"
2/10:  "Financial Overview"
```

**Bullet Examples:**
```
10/10: "Digital segment grew 28% ($18M), demonstrating self-serve model 
         scalability — expand to enterprise segment"
6/10:  "Digital segment performed well with strong growth"
2/10:  "Digital: $18M, 28%"
```

---

## THE 10/10 SLIDE TEST

A slide scores 10/10 when:
1. **Title** is so specific it only applies to this situation
2. **Structure** is so logical it feels inevitable
3. **Insights** are sharp enough to change how audience thinks
4. **Data** is so well-chosen it silences skeptics
5. **Design** is clean enough that content shines

---

## EMERGENCY FIXES

**If title is descriptive:**
Add: [Subject] + [verb] + [result] + [number]

**If structure not MECE:**
Pick framework: Revenue/Cost/Capital OR Geography/Segment/Channel

**If missing insight:**
Ask for each bullet: "Which means...?"

**If weak language:**
Find and replace: very → [delete], good → [specific metric], obviously → [delete]
