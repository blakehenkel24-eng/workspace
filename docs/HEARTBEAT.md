# HEARTBEAT.md - Hourly Checks (Cost-Conscious)

Run these checks every hour. Target: <$0.05/day.

## Every Hour
- Token/credit usage monitoring
- System health check
- Silent mode if no activity

## Morning (7:24 AM CST)
- Weather for Chicago (wttr.in - FREE)
- Market/PE tech news brief (Brave search - cheap)
- Bible verse
- Overnight work summary

## Rules
- Use haiku (Claude Haiku - cheapest model)
- Batch requests when possible
- Skip if nothing new
- Respect quiet hours (23:00-06:00 CST) — silent checks only
