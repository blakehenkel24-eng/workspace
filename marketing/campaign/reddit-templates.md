## r/consulting - Template 1: Value-Add Post

**Title:** I reviewed 200+ consulting proposals over 10 years. Here are the 5 mistakes costing you deals.

**Post:**

After a decade in consulting (both Big 4 and independent), I've seen what separates winning proposals from the recycling bin.

**The mistakes I see over and over:**

**1. Leading with credentials instead of understanding**
Clients don't care where you worked or what degrees you have. They care that you understand THEIR problem. Start there.

**2. The wall of text**
If your proposal looks like a document, you've already lost. Visual hierarchy matters. White space matters. Your proposal should be scannable in 60 seconds.

**3. Pricing by the hour**
When you break down by phase/hours, you invite negotiation on every line item. Price by outcome. "A roadmap to $200K savings" beats "40 hours of analysis" every time.

**4. No clear next steps**
"Let me know if you have questions" is not a call to action. Be specific: "Let's schedule a 30-minute review call this week to discuss any concerns."

**5. Sending the same proposal to everyone**
Customization signals effort. Effort signals care. Even 20 minutes tailoring the problem statement pays dividends.

**The 5-second rule:**

Your prospect decides whether to hire you in 5 seconds. They're not reading your methodology in those 5 seconds. They're evaluating your competence based on presentation quality.

Sounds superficial? It is. But it's reality.

**What I built:**

I got tired of watching great consultants lose deals because of presentation. So I built SlideTheory — proposal software designed specifically for consulting.

It bakes these principles into templates so you don't have to think about them.

Happy to answer any questions about proposal strategy. What mistakes are you seeing out there?

## r/consulting - Template 2: Discussion Starter

**Title:** How do you handle the portfolio problem? (Confidentiality vs. credibility)

**Post:**

One of the most frustrating parts of consulting marketing: Your best work is under NDA, but prospects want proof before hiring you.

**The approaches I've seen:**

1. **Anonymous case studies** - "A $500M retailer faced X challenge..." No names, but situation/approach/results

2. **Methodology showcase** - Show HOW you think, not WHO you've worked with

3. **Thought leadership** - Write so deeply about problems that your expertise is obvious

4. **Referral dependency** - Hope your network carries you (unpredictable)

5. **Generic capabilities** - "We do strategy, operations, and transformation" (sounds like everyone)

**What works for you?**

I've found anonymous case studies + deep content marketing to be the most scalable, but it's slow to build.

Also — shameless plug — this is why I built SlideTheory with methodology showcase templates. Sometimes showing HOW you solve problems is more compelling than showing WHO you've solved them for.

Curious about your experience.

## r/consulting - Template 3: Career Advice

**Title:** Solo consultants: How do you compete with big firm proposals?

**Post:**

I went from Big 4 to independent consulting 5 years ago. Hardest adjustment? Proposals.

At [Big 4], I had:
- Design teams polishing every deck
- Library of past proposals to reference
- Brand recognition that opened doors

As a solo consultant, I had:
- PowerPoint
- Google
- Imposter syndrome

**What I learned:**

You can't out-resource big firms. But you CAN out-position them.

**Tactics that work:**

1. **Niche down aggressively** - "I help SaaS companies reduce churn" beats "I do strategy"

2. **Pre-read decks** - Send 3-5 custom slides BEFORE the meeting. Shows understanding, builds credibility

3. **Outcome-based pricing** - "$20K for a roadmap to $200K savings" beats hourly rates

4. **Speed as advantage** - Big firms move slow. Be responsive. Be decisive.

5. **Professional presentation** - This was my biggest gap. I built SlideTheory to solve it — consulting-specific templates that compete with big firm decks.

**Questions for fellow independents:**

- How do you handle proposal creation?
- What percentage of your time goes to business development vs. delivery?
- Any tools that have helped?

## r/startups - Template 1: Founder Story

**Title:** I built a product for consultants after watching them lose deals they should have won

**Post:**

**Background:**

Spent 10 years in consulting — from boutique firms to advising Fortune 500 companies. Built proposals for $50M+ in engagements.

**The problem I kept seeing:**

Brilliant consultants losing deals to inferior competitors. Not because they lacked capability. Because they lacked presentation.

A McKinsey partner can send a Word doc and get a meeting. A solo consultant sending the same doc gets ignored.

**Why this matters for startups:**

If you're selling B2B services — consulting, dev shops, agencies — your proposal IS your product demo. It signals your competence before you say a word.

**What I built:**

SlideTheory — presentation software designed specifically for consulting proposals.

**Key lessons from the build:**

1. **Niche beats general** - I could have built "better presentations for everyone." Instead: "proposals for consultants." Much clearer value prop.

2. **Templates > blank pages** - Even experts want starting points. Our templates are based on 200+ winning proposals.

3. **Psychology > features** - We focused on conversion psychology (how clients actually make decisions) instead of animation libraries.

**Current status:**

Bootstrapped, profitable, growing. Just hit $10K MRR.

**AMA** about:
- Building productized services
- B2B sales psychology
- Bootstrapping SaaS
- Consulting as a path to entrepreneurship

## r/startups - Template 2: Lessons Learned

**Title:** Lessons from 10 years in consulting before starting up

**Post:**

Made the leap from consulting to startup founder last year. Some lessons that surprised me:

**1. Selling services taught me more about product than building products**

In consulting, you sell before you build. Every. Single. Time. That muscle — selling vision, managing expectations, iterating based on feedback — translates perfectly to product.

**2. The proposal skills transfer directly**

Pitch decks are just proposals with different audiences. Same psychology:
- Lead with their problem
- Show, don't tell
- Price by value
- Clear next steps

**3. Network effects are real**

My first 50 customers came from my consulting network. Relationships built over years paid off overnight.

**4. Documentation matters more than you'd think**

In consulting, "I sent the proposal" was the end of the sales process. In product, that's when support starts. Documenting everything (which consulting trained me to do) saved me countless hours.

**5. The tools I built for myself became the product**

SlideTheory started as internal templates I used for client proposals. When other consultants started asking for them, I knew I had something.

**The biggest surprise:**

How similar consulting and startups actually are. Both are:
- Solving ambiguous problems
- Selling before building
- Managing uncertainty
- Building trust quickly

**For consultants thinking about starting up:**

Your skills transfer more than you think. The risk isn't that you'll fail — it's that you'll wait too long to try.

Happy to answer questions about the transition.

## r/startups - Template 3: Marketing Strategy Discussion

**Title:** Marketing a B2B tool to consultants — strategies that worked

**Post:**

Launched SlideTheory (proposal software for consultants) 6 months ago. Here's what's actually worked for customer acquisition:

**What worked:**

**1. Content marketing in niche communities**

r/consulting, consulting LinkedIn groups, industry Slack channels. Not broad "business" content — specific, tactical advice for consultants.

**2. Founder stories**

"I was a consultant, here's what I learned" performs better than "Here's our product." Authenticity matters in B2B.

**3. Template giveaways**

Free proposal templates with email capture. High-value lead magnet, low friction.

**4. Podcast guesting**

Consulting podcasts have small but targeted audiences. One appearance = 10-15 qualified trials.

**5. Partnerships with complementary tools**

CRM tools, project management software, freelance platforms. Shared audience, mutual benefit.

**What didn't work:**

- Google Ads (too expensive for our price point)
- LinkedIn ads (low conversion)
- Broad "productivity" content (wrong audience)

**Surprising insight:**

Consultants buy tools differently than other B2B buyers. They research extensively, try free versions thoroughly, and decide slowly. But once decided, they stay loyal and refer others.

**Current focus:**

Building case studies and social proof. In B2B, "Company X uses SlideTheory" is worth more than any ad spend.

**Questions for the community:**

- Any other channels I should be exploring?
- How do you approach B2B content marketing?
- What's worked for niche product launches?
