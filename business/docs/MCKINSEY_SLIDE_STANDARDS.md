## 1. SLIDE QUALITY RUBRIC (1-10 Scoring System)

### Overall Score Interpretation
| Score | Rating | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 10 | Exceptional | Partner-ready, could present to Board without revision |
| 9 | Excellent | Minor polish only, client-ready |
| 8 | Good | Solid consulting quality, small improvements needed |
| 7 | Acceptable | Meets minimum standards, noticeable gaps |
| 6 | Below Standard | Missing key consulting principles |
| ≤5 | Unacceptable | Requires significant rework |

### Detailed Scoring Matrix

#### A. TITLE QUALITY (Weight: 25%)
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 10 | Perfect action title: complete sentence, specific insight, "so what" evident, compelling |
| 9 | Strong action title, minor wording improvement possible |
| 8 | Action-oriented but could be more specific or insightful |
| 7 | Attempts action title but still somewhat descriptive |
| 6 | Hybrid title (some action, some description) |
| 5 | Descriptive title with weak action element |
| ≤4 | Purely descriptive ("Market Analysis", "Overview") |

**Examples:**
- **10:** "Acquisition accelerates market entry by 18 months, capturing $45M incremental revenue"
- **8:** "Market expansion creates growth opportunity in adjacent segments"
- **5:** "Market analysis and expansion opportunities"
- **2:** "Market Overview"

---

#### B. STRUCTURE & LOGIC (Weight: 25%)
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 10 | Perfect MECE structure, clear pyramid flow, each element supports the one above |
| 9 | Strong MECE, minor overlap or gap |
| 8 | Mostly MECE, one category overlap or small gap |
| 7 | Attempts MECE but 2+ overlaps or gaps |
| 6 | Logical structure but not MECE |
| 5 | Somewhat logical but confusing flow |
| ≤4 | Random organization, no clear structure |

**MECE Violations to Flag:**
- Overlap: Categories that aren't mutually exclusive (e.g., "Enterprise Customers" and "Tech Industry" — enterprise customers include tech companies)
- Gaps: Missing obvious categories (analyzing "all customers" but only covering 80%)
- Bucketing errors: Grouping by two different dimensions simultaneously

---

#### C. CONTENT INSIGHT (Weight: 20%)
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 10 | Every bullet has insight + data + "so what"; novel synthesis from raw data |
| 9 | Strong insights throughout, one or two descriptive bullets |
| 8 | Good insights, some bullets lack "so what" |
| 7 | Mix of insights and descriptions |
| 6 | Mostly descriptive with occasional insight |
| 5 | Descriptive content with weak insights |
| ≤4 | Just facts/descriptions, no insight layer |

**Insight Quality Check:**
- Does it answer "So what?"
- Is it defensible from the data?
- Would the client learn something new?
- Is it specific (not generic)?

---

#### D. VISUAL HIERARCHY (Weight: 15%)
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 10 | Perfect visual hierarchy, eye flows naturally from insight to supporting data |
| 9 | Excellent hierarchy, minor improvement possible |
| 8 | Good hierarchy, clear what's most important |
| 7 | Adequate but some confusion about priorities |
| 6 | Weak hierarchy, everything seems equally important |
| 5 | Flat, no clear visual differentiation |
| ≤4 | Cluttered or confusing layout |

**Visual Hierarchy Principles:**
1. Title largest and most prominent
2. Key message visually distinct (callout box, color)
3. Supporting data secondary but clear
4. Sources/footnotes smallest
5. White space used strategically

---

#### E. DATA PRESENTATION (Weight: 10%)
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 10 | Perfect data formatting, every number contextualized, sources cited |
| 9 | Excellent data presentation, minor formatting issue |
| 8 | Good data, appropriate rounding/units |
| 7 | Acceptable but inconsistent formatting |
| 6 | Data present but poorly formatted |
| 5 | Data without context or sources |
| ≤4 | Missing key data or misleading presentation |

**Data Standards:**
- Large numbers: Use K/M/B (e.g., "$45M" not "$45,000,000")
- Percentages: Always show base size ("65% of customers" not just "65%")
- Time periods: Clear and consistent ("YoY" or "2024 vs 2023")
- Sources: Cite for all external data
- Significance: Explain why the number matters

---

#### F. LANGUAGE & TONE (Weight: 5%)
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 10 | Perfect consulting tone, active voice, zero filler words |
| 9 | Excellent, one or two weak words |
| 8 | Good consulting language |
| 7 | Mostly professional, some casual language |
| 6 | Inconsistent tone |
| 5 | Too casual or too academic |
| ≤4 | Inappropriate for consulting context |

**Prohibited Words:**
- Weak qualifiers: very, really, quite, pretty, fairly
- Uncertainty: maybe, perhaps, possibly, might, could (unless genuine uncertainty)
- Filler: obviously, clearly, basically, essentially
- Vague: good, bad, nice, interesting

**Preferred Action Verbs:**
Accelerate, capture, drive, enable, execute, expand, exploit, leverage, optimize, prioritize, scale, streamline, unlock

### Component Breakdown

#### 1. ACTION TITLE (Top of Pyramid)
**Purpose:** Communicate the single most important takeaway
**Requirements:**
- Complete sentence with subject + verb + object
- Includes the "so what" or key implication
- Specific, not generic (includes numbers where possible)
- 8-12 words maximum
- No punctuation at end (McKinsey standard)

**Formula Options:**
- [Subject] + [verb] + [outcome] + [driver]
- "Revenue growth accelerated to 15% driven by digital transformation"
- [Action] + [benefit] + [mechanism]
- "Consolidating vendors reduces costs by $2.3M annually through volume discounts"

**Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ "Financial Performance" (just a topic)
- ❌ "Q3 Results Review" (just timing)
- ❌ "Customer Analysis" (just a subject)
- ❌ "Why we should acquire" (too vague)

---

#### 2. KEY MESSAGE (The Governing Thought)
**Purpose:** Bridge between title and supporting points
**Requirements:**
- 1-2 sentences maximum
- Expands on the title's insight
- Sets up the structure of supporting points
- Answers "Why should the audience care?"

**Example:**
- Title: "Market entry strategy captures $120M opportunity in 3 years"
- Key Message: "Entering the European market through acquisition provides faster scale than organic growth, with break-even by Month 18."

---

#### 3. SUPPORTING POINTS (MECE Structure)
**Purpose:** Prove the key message with evidence
**Requirements:**
- 2-4 points (3 is ideal)
- Mutually exclusive: No overlap between points
- Collectively exhaustive: Cover the full scope
- Each point has: Insight + Data + "So what"
- Parallel structure (grammatically consistent)

**MECE Frameworks (Use These):**

| Situation | MECE Framework |
|-----------|----------------|
| Financial analysis | Revenue, Cost, Capital |
| Market analysis | Geography, Segment, Channel |
| Time-based | Short-term, Medium-term, Long-term |
| Option comparison | Option A, Option B, Option C |
| Risk analysis | Probability × Impact matrix |
| Org analysis | People, Process, Technology |

**Anti-MECE Patterns:**
- Mixing dimensions: "Product Quality, Customer Service, Europe Region" (first two are capabilities, third is geography)
- Overlapping categories: "Enterprise Customers" and "Fortune 500" (all Fortune 500 are enterprise)
- Missing the "other" category when appropriate

---

#### 4. DATA HIGHLIGHTS
**Purpose:** Provide evidence for claims
**Requirements:**
- Every claim has supporting data
- Data is formatted consistently
- Context explains what the number means
- Sources cited for external data

**Structure:**
```
[Metric] + [Context] + [Implication]

Example:
Metric: "73% market share"
Context: "in the enterprise segment"
Implication: "provides pricing power and barrier to entry"
```

---

#### 5. VISUAL ELEMENTS
**Purpose:** Support comprehension, not decoration
**Requirements:**
- Chart type matches the message
- Chart has its own action title
- No chartjunk (3D, excessive colors, gridlines)
- Legend clear and positioned logically
- Axis labels explicit

**Chart Selection Guide:**

| Message Type | Chart Type | Example |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| Comparison across categories | Bar chart | Market share by competitor |
| Trend over time | Line chart | Revenue growth 2020-2024 |
| Part-to-whole | Stacked bar | Cost breakdown by category |
| Correlation | Scatter plot | Price vs. volume relationship |
| Flow/sequence | Waterfall | Bridge from 2023 to 2024 profit |
| Ranking | Horizontal bar | Top 10 customers by revenue |

---

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES & PREVENTION

### FAILURE MODE 1: Descriptive Titles
**Symptoms:**
- Title is just a topic ("Market Analysis")
- Title states the obvious ("Revenue Has Increased")
- Title asks a question ("Should We Acquire?")

**Root Cause:**
- Fear of being wrong (descriptive is safe)
- Unclear what the insight actually is
- Rushing to create slide before thinking

**Prevention:**
1. Write the title LAST, after content is structured
2. Ask: "What would surprise the audience?"
3. Test: "If I deleted everything but the title, would they get the point?"
4. Ensure title passes "so what" test

**Before/After:**
- ❌ "Q3 Financial Performance"
- ✅ "Q3 EBITDA exceeded target by 12% driven by cost optimization"

---

### FAILURE MODE 2: Non-MECE Structure
**Symptoms:**
- Categories overlap (double-counting)
- Categories leave gaps (missing data)
- Mixing different dimensions
- "Other" category is >20% of total

**Root Cause:**
- Lazy bucketing (grouping what comes to mind)
- Not testing for mutual exclusivity
- Not verifying collective exhaustiveness

**Prevention:**
1. Use established MECE frameworks (see above)
2. Test: "Can any item fit in two categories?" (if yes, not MECE)
3. Test: "Is there anything that doesn't fit?" (if yes, gap exists)
4. Calculate: Does sum of parts equal the whole?

**Before/After:**
- ❌ "Revenue drivers: Digital, Enterprise, International, Top 10 Accounts" (overlap: Enterprise includes Digital and International)
- ✅ "Revenue drivers by channel: Direct sales, Partners, Digital self-serve"

---

### FAILURE MODE 3: Data Without Insight
**Symptoms:**
- Bullet is just a fact ("Revenue was $50M")
- No explanation of why it matters
- Client could have read this in the appendix

**Root Cause:**
- Confusing data collection with analysis
- Thinking "more data = more credibility"
- Not asking "so what?" for each point

**Prevention:**
1. For every data point, add: "Which means..."
2. Ask: "Would the client already know this?"
3. Ask: "Does this change any decisions?"
4. Delete data that doesn't support an insight

**Before/After:**
- ❌ "Customer satisfaction score is 8.2"
- ✅ "Customer satisfaction improved to 8.2 (+0.4), reducing churn risk for 15% of at-risk accounts"

---

### FAILURE MODE 4: Weak Visual Hierarchy
**Symptoms:**
- Everything same font size/weight
- No clear focal point
- Eye doesn't know where to start
- Text walls with no breathing room

**Root Cause:**
- Fear of white space (must fill the slide!)
- Not designing for how eyes scan
- Trying to say too much

**Prevention:**
1. Design rule: Most important element = largest/most contrast
2. Use white space intentionally (it's not wasted)
3. Limit to one focal point per slide
4. Test: Squint at slide — what stands out?

---

### FAILURE MODE 5: Consulting Jargon
**Symptoms:**
- "Leveraging core competencies to drive synergies"
- "Holistic optimization of value creation levers"
- Buzzwords without specific meaning

**Root Cause:**
- Hiding weak thinking behind big words
- Imitating bad consulting habits
- Trying to sound "strategic"

**Prevention:**
1. Ask: "Would I say this to a friend?"
2. Replace abstractions with specifics
3. Cut every word that doesn't add meaning
4. Read aloud — if it sounds ridiculous, rewrite

**Before/After:**
- ❌ "We will leverage our core competencies to optimize the value proposition"
- ✅ "We'll use our manufacturing expertise to reduce production costs by 15%"

---

### FAILURE MODE 6: The "Kitchen Sink" Slide
**Symptoms:**
- 6+ supporting points
- Multiple unrelated insights
- Takes 5+ minutes to present
- Audience looks confused

**Root Cause:**
- Inability to prioritize (everything is important!)
- Unclear what the main point actually is
- Trying to prove how much work was done

**Prevention:**
1. Rule: One slide = one point
2. If you have 5 insights, use 5 slides
3. Ask: "What's the one thing they must remember?"
4. Move supporting evidence to appendix

---

## 4. EXAMPLES: GOOD VS BAD

### EXAMPLE 1: Executive Summary Slide

**BAD (Score: 4/10)**
```
Q3 Financial Performance

Q3 was a good quarter for the company. We saw growth in 
multiple areas and are well-positioned for the future.

• Revenue increased
• Costs were managed well
• Customer acquisition improved
• Product launches successful
• Team morale high

[Generic bar chart showing revenue over time]
```

**Problems:**
- Descriptive title (0/10)
- Vague, unsupported claims
- No data or specifics
- No MECE structure (why these 5 points?)
- "Good" is subjective

---

**GOOD (Score: 9/10)**
```
Q3 EBITDA exceeds target by 12% driven by cost optimization

Strong operational performance creates momentum for Q4 
and positions us to exceed full-year guidance.

┌────────────────┬────────────────┬────────────────┐
│ Revenue Growth │ Cost Reduction │ Margin Impact  │
├────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┤
│ • +8% vs Q3    │ • COGS -3%     │ • EBITDA       │

```

**Why it's good:**
- Action title with specific insight and number
- Key message sets up the structure
- MECE framework: Revenue, Cost, Margin
- Every point has data + implication
- Chart type matches message (waterfall = bridge)

---

### EXAMPLE 2: Issue Tree Slide

**BAD (Score: 3/10)**
```
Why Are Sales Declining?

• Competition is tough
• Economy is bad
• Product is old
• Marketing isn't working
• Sales team turnover
• Prices too high
• Customer preferences changed

[Random list with no structure]
```

**Problems:**
- Title asks question (no insight)
- No MECE structure (why 7 items?)
- Overlaps: "Competition" + "Prices too high"
- No data
- Not collectively exhaustive (what about operations?)

---

**GOOD (Score: 9/10)**

Priorities: (1) Enterprise retention program 
            (2) Streamline enterprise sales process
```

**Why it's good:**
- Action title with root cause identified
- Perfect MECE: New customers vs. Churn (no overlap, covers all sales)
- Each branch has supporting data
- Priorities indicate next steps
- Issue tree structure visually clear

---

### EXAMPLE 3: Comparison Slide

**BAD (Score: 5/10)**
```
Acquisition Options Analysis

We looked at three potential acquisition targets.

Company A: Good technology, strong team, expensive
Company B: Okay fit, cheaper, slower growth
Company C: Emerging player, risky, high potential

Our recommendation is Company A.
```

**Problems:**
- Descriptive title
- No structured comparison criteria
- Subjective assessments ("good", "okay")
- No quantitative data
- Recommendation without clear rationale

Implementation Plan

First we need to do discovery. Then we will analyze
what we found. After that we'll design the solution.
Then we build it. Then we test. Then we deploy.

## 5. SLIDE LAYOUT DECISION TREE

Use this flowchart to select the appropriate layout:

```
START: What is the primary message?
│
├─► Presenting a single key insight with supporting data?
│   └─► Use: EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY
│       Structure: Title → Key Message → 3 Supporting Points → Chart
│
├─► Breaking down a complex problem into components?
│   └─► Use: ISSUE-TREE
│       Structure: Root Problem → 2-4 MECE Branches → Sub-branches
│
├─► Comparing options on two dimensions?
│   └─► Use: 2X2-MATRIX
│       Structure: X-axis → Y-axis → 4 Quadrants → Strategic implications
│
├─► Showing progression from one value to another?
│   └─► Use: WATERFALL
│       Structure: Start → Increases → Decreases → End
│
├─► Comparing multiple options across criteria?
│   └─► Use: COMPARISON
│       Structure: Criteria × Options matrix → Recommendation
│
├─► Describing a sequence of steps or workflow?
│   └─► Use: PROCESS-FLOW
│       Structure: Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Outcome
│
└─► None of the above clearly fit?
    └─► Use: EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY (most flexible)
```

- [ ] Does each point support the title?
- [ ] Is the logic flow clear?

### Content
- [ ] Every bullet has data
- [ ] Every bullet explains what it means
- [ ] Sources cited for external data
- [ ] No filler or obvious statements

### Visual
- [ ] Clear visual hierarchy (most important = most prominent)
- [ ] Chart type matches message
- [ ] White space used intentionally
- [ ] No design clutter

### Language
- [ ] Active voice throughout
- [ ] No prohibited words (very, really, obviously)
- [ ] Action verbs preferred
- [ ] Specific, not vague

---

## 7. PROMPT ENGINEERING GUIDANCE FOR AI

When generating slides via AI, use these prompt patterns:

### Pattern 1: The Full Context
```
Create a consultant-quality slide about [TOPIC].

Context:
- [Key fact 1]
- [Key fact 2]
- [Key fact 3]

Key Takeaway: [The main point the audience should remember]

Audience: [C-level / Board / Mid-management / Technical]

Requirements:
1. Action title with specific insight
2. MECE structure (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive)
3. Every point must have data + "so what?"
4. Include appropriate chart recommendation
5. Cite sources for all external data
```

### Pattern 2: The Restructure
```
Restructure this slide to meet McKinsey standards:

Current slide:

## 8. BENCHMARK: WHAT "MCKINSEY-LEVEL" MEANS

### The Standard
A McKinsey-level slide can be:
- Presented to a Board of Directors without revision
- Understood in 30 seconds by a busy executive
- Defended in a tough Q&A session
- Dropped into a final presentation as-is

### The Difference Between Good and Great

| Aspect | Good (7-8/10) | Great (9-10/10) |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Title | Action-oriented | Action-oriented + surprising + memorable |
| Insight | Clear | Non-obvious synthesis from data |
| Structure | Logical | Elegant (the only way to structure it) |
| Data | Accurate | Perfectly chosen to support the argument |
| Visual | Clean | Guides the eye effortlessly |
| Impact | Informs | Persuades and moves to action |

### The 10/10 Slide Test
A slide scores 10/10 when:
1. The title is so specific it could only apply to this situation
2. The structure is so logical it feels inevitable
3. The insights are so sharp they change how the audience thinks
4. The data is so well-chosen it silences skeptics
5. The design is so clean it disappears (content shines)
