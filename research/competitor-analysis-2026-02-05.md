## 💡 Key Insights

### Market Gaps
1. **AI-Powered Generation:** None of the competitors offer AI slide generation - all rely on manual template selection
2. **Hybrid Model:** No one combines slide library + AI generation + educational content effectively
3. **Price Point:** SlideTheory's $2/mo is significantly under all competitors

### Successful Patterns to Emulate
1. **Real Examples:** SlideStart and SlideWorks both emphasize real slides from top consulting firms
2. **Educational Content:** SlideWorks' blog with frameworks (MECE, Pyramid Principle, SCR) drives authority
3. **Search/Filter:** Advanced filtering is table stakes for slide libraries
4. **Multiple Formats:** Offering both PPT templates and educational articles

### Differentiation Opportunities
1. **AI-First Approach:** Generate slides from prompts vs. browsing templates
2. **Consulting Education:** Teach the *methodology* behind great slides, not just provide templates
3. **Interactive Elements:** Tools for TAM/SAM/SOM calculation, competitive analysis frameworks
4. **Community Features:** User-contributed slides, ratings, discussions

3. **Real Examples:** Curate real slides from public sources (McKinsey presentations, SEC filings)

### Short-term

2. **Blog Content:** Start with 10 core articles covering:
   - How to write action titles like McKinsey
   - MECE framework explained

   - Market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)
   - Creating executive summaries

### Long-term
1. **Community Features:** User uploads, ratings, comments on slides
