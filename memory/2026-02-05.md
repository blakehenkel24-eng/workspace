## SlideTheory v2.0 — Production Deployment COMPLETE (2026-02-05 → 02-06)

### Major Achievement: Website LIVE
**URL:** https://slidetheory.io  
**Status:** All 7 pages deployed and accessible

**What Was Deployed:**
- ✅ Home page (index.html)
- ✅ How it Works page
- ✅ Resources page (12 resources)
- ✅ Blog page (9 articles)
- ✅ Gallery page
- ✅ Privacy Policy (GDPR/CCPA compliant)
- ✅ Terms of Service (21 sections)
- ✅ Legal docs complete
- ✅ Accessibility fixes (WCAG AA)

### Technical Infrastructure
**VPS:** Hostinger (76.13.122.30)  
**Web Server:** Nginx configured  
**SSH Access:** Established with ed25519 key  
**Deployment Method:** Git clone + manual configuration

**Backend:**
- Node.js server running on port 3000
- Kimi API integration configured
- Environment variables set (.env)
- Nginx reverse proxy for /api/ routes

### Mission Control Built
**Location:** `tools/mission-control/`  
**Features:**
- Todoist integration (real task sync)
- Agent spawning interface
- Command Center (natural language agent deployment)
- Real-time progress tracking
- Project context panel

**Status:** Functional but needs OpenClaw gateway connection to fully work

### Todoist Automation
**Completed Today:** 16+ tasks
- Legal pages
- Security features (Sentry, rate limiting)
- Database schema
- Research documents (competitive analysis, design trends, Terra Fitness)
- Educational guide created

**Routing System:** Development→Dev Agent, Design→Frontend Agent, Research→Research Agent

### Key Learnings
1. **SSH Deployment:** First successful VPS deployment with Blake
2. **Nginx Configuration:** Learned sites-available/enabled pattern
3. **Process Management:** Backend needs to stay running (npm start)
4. **Git Branches:** main vs master confusion resolved
5. **PM2 Setup:** Process manager configured for auto-restart and boot persistence

### Remaining Issues
- ✅ Backend stability — FIXED with PM2 (auto-restart + boot persistence)
- Mission Control needs gateway connection for agent spawning
- GitHub Actions workflow blocked (token needs workflow scope)
- Test slide generation end-to-end (PM2 just configured)

### Documentation Created
- `EDUCATIONAL-GUIDE.md` — 8 chapters explaining web dev fundamentals
- `DEPLOY_INSTRUCTIONS.md` — Step-by-step deployment guide
- Security audit reports
- Research analysis documents

### Next Steps
1. Stabilize backend (add PM2 or systemd service)
2. Complete Mission Control deployment
3. Test slide generation end-to-end
4. Monitor for issues
